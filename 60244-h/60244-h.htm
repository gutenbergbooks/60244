<h2><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys.</span>&mdash;Those of you who were interested
in the first story of this series, telling
how Larry Dexter rose from a copy boy to become
a reporter, may desire to follow his further
adventures as a newspaper worker. Many of
the occurrences told of in this volume are actual
ones. In some I participated personally. In others
newspaper friends of mine were concerned,
though I have made some slight changes from
what actually happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The tracing of the blue-handed man, who blew
open the safe by means of nitro-glycerine, is an
actual fact, having taken place in the city where
I live. He was arrested afterwards because a
detective observed the stains left by the acid on
his fingers. The riot in Chinatown is similar to
several that have occurred there, and kidnappings,
such as befell Jimmy, are common enough
in New York. There are few reporters, especially
on the large papers, who have not gone
through as thrilling incidents as those which happened
to Larry, for, as I can vouch from many
years&rsquo; experience, a newspaper man&rsquo;s life is anything
but a quiet and uneventful one.</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours sincerely,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Howard R. Garis</span>.</span></p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A REPORTER&rsquo;S MISTAKE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Copy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city editor&rsquo;s voice rang out sharply, and
he held in his extended hand a bunch of paper,
without lifting his eyes from the story he was
going over with a correcting pencil. There was
no answer save the clicking of half a score of
typewriters, at which sat busy reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copy!&rdquo; cried the editor once more. There
was a shuffle among a trio of boys on the far side
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copy! copy!&rdquo; fairly shouted the exasperated
editor, as he shook the papers, looking up from
his work towards the boys who were now advancing
together on a run. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
all of you? Getting deaf, or are you tired of
work? When you hear &lsquo;Copy&rsquo; called at this time
of day you want to jump! Now all the way up
to the composing room with that, Bud. It&rsquo;s got
to make the first edition!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud Nelson, head copy
boy on the New York <i>Daily Leader</i>, one of the
largest afternoon papers of the metropolis, as he
raced upstairs to where the clicking type-setting
machines were in noisy operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys must be more lively,&rdquo; went on Mr.
Bruce Emberg, the city editor. &ldquo;This is not a
playroom nor a kindergarten. You must learn
to jump up whenever you hear the assistant city
editor or myself call &lsquo;Copy.&rsquo; I make some allowances
for you boys who have not been here long,
but it must not occur again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two remaining lads went back to their
bench looking a little startled, for, though Mr.
Emberg was a kind man, he could be severe when
there was occasion for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he give you a laying-out?&rdquo; asked Bud,
of his companions, when he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just guess yes,&rdquo; replied Charles Anderson,
the tallest of the copy boys. &ldquo;You ought to have
heard him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so busy telling you fellows about the
party last night I didn&rsquo;t hear him call,&rdquo; said Bud.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be more careful, or we&rsquo;ll lose our
jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copy!&rdquo; called the editor again, and this time
the three reached the desk almost at the same
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Emberg.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I like to see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>For the next few minutes there was a busy
scene in the city room of the <i>Leader</i>. Reporters
were writing like mad on their typewriters, and
rushing with the loose sheets of paper over to the
desk of the city editor or his assistant. These,
and two copy readers, rapidly scanned the stories,
made whatever corrections were necessary, put
headings, or &ldquo;heads,&rdquo; as they are called, on them,
and gave them to the copy boys.</p>
<p>The lads ran out to the pneumatic tube that
shot the copy to the composing room, or, in case
of an important story, took it upstairs themselves
so that it would receive immediate attention from
the foreman.</p>
<p>The boys were running to and fro, as if in
training for a race, typewriters were clicking as
fast as though the operators were in a speed contest,
the editors were slashing whole pages from
stories to make them shorter, and the copy readers
were doing likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up that stuff, Jones!&rdquo; exclaimed the
editor to one reporter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only got two
minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; cried Jones, yanking the last
page from his typewriter.</p>
<p>For two minutes there was a wilder scene of
activity than ever. Then came a comparatively
quiet spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we can make for the first,&rdquo; remarked
the editor, with something like a breath
of relief. &ldquo;We did pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The editor looked over a book that lay open
in front of him on his desk. The cover was
marked &ldquo;Assignments,&rdquo; and it was the volume in
which memoranda of all the items that were to
be gotten that day appeared. The editor glanced
down the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Larry!&rdquo; he called to a tall, good-looking
youth, who was seated at a small desk. &ldquo;Get
this obituary, will you? It&rsquo;s about a man over on
the West Side. He was ninety-eight years old,
and belonged to a well-known New York family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get his picture?&rdquo; asked Larry Dexter,
as he came forward to go out on the assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t time to make it to-day. Just
get a brief sketch of his life. Hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry got his hat from the coat room, and left
the office. He was the newest reporter on the
<i>Leader</i>. The other reporters spoke of him as the
&ldquo;cub,&rdquo; not meaning anything disrespectful, but
only to indicate that he was the &ldquo;freshman,&rdquo; the
apprentice, or whatever one considers the beginner
in any line of work. Larry was a sort of
fledgling at the business, though he had been on
the <i>Leader</i> a number of months.</p>
<p>He began as a copy boy, just like one of the
lads whom Mr. Emberg had cautioned about
being in a hurry. Larry, with his mother,
his sisters, Lucy, aged thirteen, and Mary, aged
five, and his brother, James, lived in a fairly good
tenement in New York City. They had come
there from the village of Campton, New York,
where Larry&rsquo;s father, who had been dead a few
years, once owned a fine farm. But reverses had
overtaken the family, and some time after Mr.
Dexter&rsquo;s death the place was sold at auction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>When the place had been disposed of, Mrs.
Dexter desired to come to New York to live with
her sister, Mrs. Edward Ralston. But, as related
in the first volume of this series, entitled, &ldquo;From
Office Boy to Reporter; or, The First Step in
Journalism,&rdquo; when Mrs. Dexter, with Larry and
the other children, reached the big city, they
found that Mrs. Ralston&rsquo;s husband had been
killed a few days before in an accident. Mrs.
Ralston, writing a hasty letter to her sister, had
gone to live with other relatives in a distant state.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dexter did not receive this letter on
time, in consequence of having hastily undertaken
the journey from Campton, and so did not hear of
her sister&rsquo;s loss until she reached the house where
Mrs. Ralston had lived. The travelers made the
best of it, however, and were cared for by kind
neighbors.</p>
<p>Larry soon secured work as an office, or copy,
boy on the <i>Leader</i>, through one day being able
to help Harvey Newton, one of the best reporters
on the paper, at an exciting fire.</p>
<p>In those days Larry had trouble with Peter
Manton, a rival copy boy, and he was kidnapped
by some electric cab strikers who thought he was
a reporter they wanted to pay off an old score on.
The lad and Mr. Newton were sent to report a
big flood in another part of the state, where the
big dam broke, and where many persons were in
danger of being drowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>While in the flooded district Larry met his old
enemy, Peter, and there was a race between them
to see who would get some copy, telling of the
flood, to the telegraph office first. Larry won,
and for this good work was promoted from an
office boy to be a regular reporter. In the course
of his duties as a copy boy he once saved a valuable
watch from being stolen by pickpockets from
a celebrated doctor, and the physician, in his
gratitude, operated on Larry&rsquo;s sister Lucy, who
suffered from a bad spinal disease, and cured her.</p>
<p>This made the family feel much happier, as
now Lucy could go about like other girls, and
did not have to spend many hours in a big chair.
Larry&rsquo;s advancement also brought him a larger
salary, so there was no further need for Mrs.
Dexter to take in sewing. They were able also
to move to a better apartment, though not far
from where they had first settled.</p>
<p>Larry was able to put a little money in the
bank, to add to the nest-egg of one thousand dollars
which he received as a reward for finding
the Reynolds jewels, though the thieves were not
apprehended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Larry had been acting in his new position as
reporter about eight months when, on the morning
that our story opens, he was sent to get the
obituary of the aged man. In this time he had
learned much that he never knew before, and
which would not have come to him in his capacity
as copy boy. He had, as yet, been given only
easy work, for though he had shown &ldquo;a nose for
news,&rdquo; as it is called, which means an ability to
know a story when it comes one&rsquo;s way, Mr. Emberg
felt the &ldquo;cub&rdquo; had better go a bit slow.</p>
<p>The young reporter managed to get what information
he wanted without much trouble. He
came back to the office, and wrote it up by hand,
for he had not learned yet to use a typewriter.
While he was engaged on the &ldquo;obit,&rdquo; as death
accounts are called for brevity, he had his eyes
opened to something which stood him in good
stead the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The first editions of other New York afternoon
papers, all rivals of the <i>Leader</i>, had come into the
<i>Leader</i> office. Mr. Emberg was glancing over
them to see if his sheet had been beaten on any
stories; that is, whether any of the other journals
had stories which the <i>Leader</i> did not have, or
better ones than those on similar subjects that
appeared in the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the city editor exclaimed,
suddenly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a big story of a fight
at that Eleventh Ward political meeting, in the
<i>Scorcher</i>. Who covered that meeting for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied a tall, thin youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have anything good in your story?&rdquo;
the editor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, sir,&rdquo; stammered the youth, as he
saw the angry look on the editor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there wasn&rsquo;t any meeting,&rdquo; replied
the luckless scribe. &ldquo;It broke up in a free
fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It what?&rdquo; fairly roared the city editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It broke up in a fight. The candidates tried
to speak, but the crowd wouldn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em. They
called &rsquo;em names, and then they made a rush, and
upset the stand, and there was a free fight. I
couldn&rsquo;t hear any of the speeches, so I came
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; asked the editor, trying to speak
calmly. The room seemed strangely quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came away. I thought you sent me to report
the political meeting, but there wasn&rsquo;t any.
It broke up in a fight,&rdquo; repeated the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you were a newspaper
man,&rdquo; the city editor remarked. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have hired you if I knew you had had no experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did have some. I&mdash;I,&rdquo; began the unfortunate
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been as society scribbler on the
<i>Punktown Monthly Pink Tea Gazette</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t know enough
about the business to report a Sunday school picnic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were sent to a house to get an account
of a wedding,&rdquo; went on Mr. Emberg, &ldquo;and
while there the house should burn down, and all
the people be killed, I suppose you would come
back and say there wasn&rsquo;t any wedding, it was a
fire! Would you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you would! I don&rsquo;t believe
you&rsquo;re cut out for the newspaper business. The
idea of not reporting a meeting because it broke
up in a fight! It&rsquo;s enough to make&mdash;but never
mind! You can go to the cashier and get what
money is coming to you. We can&rsquo;t afford to have
mistakes like that occur. This is the best story
in many a day. Why, they must have had a regular
riot up there, according to the <i>Scorcher</i>. Here,
Smith,&rdquo; the city editor went on, turning to an
older reporter, &ldquo;see what there is in this, and fix
up a story,&rdquo; and Mr. Emberg handed over the
article he had clipped from the rival paper. It
was a bad beat on the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I never make a mistake like that,&rdquo;
thought Larry, as he turned in his article. &ldquo;My,
that was a call-down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AMATEUR NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The unfortunate reporter who had made the
mistake, and who had been discharged in consequence,
left the room. He had gained his position
under somewhat false pretenses, and so
there was little sympathy felt for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want careless work on the <i>Leader</i>,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Emberg, speaking to no one in particular.
&ldquo;We want the news, and those who have
no noses for it had better look alive. We&rsquo;re
in the news business, and that&rsquo;s what we have
to give the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter, to whom Mr. Emberg had given
the clipping, soon ascertained that, in the main,
it was correct. So a story was made up concerning
the Eleventh Ward meeting, and run in the
second edition of the <i>Leader</i>, much to the disgust
of the city editor, who hated to be &ldquo;beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The rebuke the unfortunate reporter received
produced a feeling of uneasiness among the others
on the staff of the <i>Leader</i>, and there were
many whispered conferences among the men that
afternoon. However the &ldquo;ax&rdquo; did not fall
again, much to the relief of several who knew
they had not been doing as well as they might&mdash;the
&ldquo;ax&rdquo; being the reporter&rsquo;s slang for getting
discharged.</p>
<p>When the last edition had been run off on the
thundering presses in the basement, the reporters
gathered in small groups in different parts
of the room, and began talking over the events
of the day. Larry saw his friend Harvey Newton
come in from an assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you make out to-day, Larry?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty fair,&rdquo; responded the boy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
have any big stories, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come in time. Better go slow and
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you strike anything good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I&rsquo;ve been down to City Hall all
day, working on a tip I got of some land deal
a political gang is trying to put through. Something
about a big tract in the Bronx, but I didn&rsquo;t
land it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark made Larry stop and think. He
remembered his mother had, among her papers,
a deed to some land in that section of New York
City called the Bronx, because it was near a
small river of that name. The land had been
taken by Mr. Dexter in connection with some
deal, and had never been considered of any value.
One day, as told in the previous volume, Mrs.
Dexter was about to destroy the old deed, but
Larry restrained her. He thought the land might
some day be of value. So the document was put
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>When Mr. Newton spoke Larry wondered if,
by any chance, the land the reporter mentioned
as being that over which a political deal was
being made, could be located near that which was
represented by the old deed. He made up his
mind to speak of it some time.</p>
<p>It was now about four o&rsquo;clock, and, as the reporters
went off duty in half an hour, Mr. Emberg
was busy over the assignment book.</p>
<p>The <i>Leader</i> was an afternoon paper, but sometimes
there were things occurring at night that
had to be &ldquo;covered&rdquo; or attended to in order to
get an account of them for the next day. Usually
only very important events were covered at
night by the <i>Leader</i>, since the morning papers,
or news associations, got accounts of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Emberg came over toward Larry with a
slip of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to try your hand at a
funny story?&rdquo; the city editor asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, only I don&rsquo;t know that I could do
it. What sort of a story is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amateur night at a theater. Did you ever
see one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Larry said he had not, and Mr. Emberg explained
that the managers of certain cheap theaters,
in order to get some variety, frequently
had amateur nights at their playhouses. They
would allow any one who came along to go on
the stage between the acts of the regular performance,
and sing, dance, recite, do feats of
strength, or whatever the amateur considered his
specialty.</p>
<p>The audience, for the most part made up of
young men and women, seldom had much sympathy
to waste on the amateurs, and it must be
a very brave youth or maiden who essayed to do
a &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two tickets to the Jollity Theater,&rdquo;
said Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;Go up there to-night, take
someone with you if you like, and give us a good
funny story to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry was delighted at being able to go to the
theater without paying, but he was a little doubtful
of his ability to do the story. However, he
resolved to try. He told his mother of it at supper
last night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Jimmy with me,&rdquo; said Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your brother&rsquo;s too young to go out,
as you will have to stay rather late,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Dexter. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take Harry Lake?&rdquo; referring
to a boy who lived on the floor below the
Dexter apartments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I will,&rdquo; replied the young reporter,
and soon he and Harry were on their way to the
theater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The play was one of the usual melodramatic
sort but to Larry and Harry it was very interesting.
They watched eagerly through the first
act, as did hundreds around them, but there was
more interest displayed when the manager came
before the curtain.</p>
<p>He announced that a number of amateurs had
come to go through their various &ldquo;turns,&rdquo; and
added that they would be allowed to stay and
amuse the audience as long as the latter seemed
to care for the offerings. When too much displeasure
was manifested the performers would be
obliged to withdraw, being forcibly reminded to
leave, sometimes, by being pulled from the boards
by a long-handled hook which the stage hands
stuck out from the wings, or sides of the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Carroll, in a song and dance specialty,&rdquo;
announced the manager as the first number,
and then he retired to give place to Johnny.
The latter proved to be a tall, thin youth, who
shuffled out upon the stage and stood there looking
about rather sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies an&rsquo; gen&rsquo;men,&rdquo; he began in such weak
tones that someone shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your voice out yer pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; dance a jig!&rdquo; cried Johnny, defiantly,
and the orchestra struck up a lively tune.
Three times the young performer tried to get into
step, but something seemed to be the matter with
his feet, for they would not jig. A general laugh
ran around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; sing!&rdquo; cried Johnny, in desperation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you that latest song success, entitled,
&lsquo;Give Me Another Transfer, This One
Has Expired,&rsquo;&rdquo; and the orchestra began playing
the opening strains. Johnny opened his mouth
to sing, but, as his voice was rather less harmonious
than a crow&rsquo;s, he was met with howls
of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ou&rsquo;t ye was goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; sing!&rdquo; someone in the
top gallery shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a chanst!&rdquo; pleaded the performer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the hook! Get the hook!&rdquo; shouted several,
and out from the wings came an instrument
like a shepherd&rsquo;s crook. Johnny was removed
from the stage, protesting in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sammy Snipe will play the mouth organ,&rdquo;
announced the manager, and Sammy came on.
He seemed to be an old hand at the turn, for he
entered with an air of confidence, and was greeted
with some applause. He lost no time in talking,
but began to play, and made not unmusical
sounds on the harmonica. He made a &ldquo;hit&rdquo; with
the audience, and there were no discouraging remarks.
Sammy played several popular airs, and
then tried to play a jig and dance it at the same
time. Sammy would have done better, however,
to have stopped when he had the approval of his
audience. Unfortunately he could not divide his
attention between his playing and his dancing.
While he could do either separately, when he essayed
both he found he had tried to cover too
much territory. He started off on a lively air,
but, no sooner had he danced a few steps, than
he forgot to keep playing, and he soon lost time.
Then he tried to start dancing, and come in with
the music when he had the jig going well. This,
too, failed, for he soon forgot to dance, and only
played.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away; he&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo; the audience
shouted, and then came the fatal call: &ldquo;Get the
hook!&rdquo; and Sammy was removed.</p>
<p>Next a young woman appeared who tried to
recite &ldquo;Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night!&rdquo; The
audience either had no regard for the curfew, or
did not care to hear anything tragic. The young
woman got as far as the third line when there
was a series of groans that indicated anything
but enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding-dong! Ten o&rsquo;clock! Time&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; called
someone, and the performer retired in confusion.</p>
<p>Larry and Harry were enjoying the efforts of
the amateurs more than they had the real show.
They were anxious for the second act to be over
to see what the unprofessional performers would
offer next.</p>
<p>When the curtain was rung down the second
time, leaving the heroine in great trouble and distress,
the next amateur performer was another
young woman who wanted to recite. She selected
&ldquo;Paul Revere&rsquo;s Ride,&rdquo; and began in a loud
tone: &ldquo;Listen, my Children&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but she had only
gone that far when someone in a high falsetto
voice called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mercy, mother, did you put the cat out,
and lock the door?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>This was too much for the elocutionist, and
she rushed off the stage in confusion. Next appeared
a tall young man with light hair, and a
purple necktie, who tried to sing: &ldquo;Come Where
My Love Lies Dreaming.&rdquo; He managed to make
himself heard through two lines, and then such a
chorus of yells, whistles, and cat-calls, mingled
with &ldquo;Get the hook!&rdquo; broke out, that he had to
stand helpless. He was game, however, and
Larry could see, by the motion of the youth&rsquo;s
lips, that the performer was going through with
the song. But not a sound of it was heard, and
there was no second verse.</p>
<p>This was followed by two boys who managed
to get through some buck and wing dancing, winning
hearty applause. Next there was a youth
who essayed a tumbling act.</p>
<p>He, too, seemed to please, and did not get the
&ldquo;hook.&rdquo; Not so fortunate, however, was the
following performer, who was announced as a
&ldquo;strong man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several stage hands carried a number of heavy
weights out on the boards. The &ldquo;strong man&rdquo;
in pink tights, making several bows, lifted a few
dumb-bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I kin do that meself!&rdquo; exclaimed a disgusted
newsboy, leaning far over the edge of the
gallery. &ldquo;Do a hard one, or go back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performer next tackled a big dumb-bell
that must have weighed several hundred pounds.
Either he had underestimated its heft, or he had
overestimated his powers, for he could not budge
it. He strained and tugged, but the bell did not
move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fake! No good! Get the hook!&rdquo; were some
of the cries that greeted the man.</p>
<p>He was pulled from the stage by some of the
hands, and two of them came on to move the
weights. Then it was disclosed that a trick had
been played on the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; man for the big
dumb-bell was merely made of wood, painted to
resemble iron. It had been fastened to the floor
with hooks, which accounted for the inability of
the performer to move it.</p>
<p>One of the stage hands, unfastening the bell,
lifted it easily with one hand. Then the laughter
broke out louder than ever, Larry and Harry
joining in.</p>
<p>Between the third and fourth acts other amateurs
appeared. Some did fairly well, but most
of them had a bad attack of stage fright, or
were scared by the remarks made to them by the
audience. Altogether it was a funny experience.</p>
<p>Larry was so anxious to make a good story
that he sat up after he reached home that night,
and wrote it out, just as he had seen it. He gave
it a lively touch, and made the most of the situations.
It was with some anxiousness, however,
that he placed the story on Mr. Emberg&rsquo;s desk
the next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON TRACK OF A DEAL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the city editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story of amateur night,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d forgotten all about it. I&rsquo;m glad
you have the copy in early, as I want you to make
a quick trip out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more floods?&rdquo; asked Larry, thinking of
the big one he had helped cover when he was
a copy boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time; this is only to take a run over
to New Jersey, to a little town called Cranford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to see Professor Allen. He is
to deliver a lecture at the dinner of the Engineers&rsquo;
Club to-night, and he has promised a copy
of his remarks in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry was soon on his way, crossing the Hudson
River on the ferry to the New Jersey side,
where he took a train for Cranford. He found
Professor Allen&rsquo;s house without much trouble,
and inquired for the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you can see him,&rdquo; replied the
girl who answered the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not; isn&rsquo;t he at home?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is and he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the servant.
&ldquo;You see he&rsquo;s out in his laboratory making experiments,
which is what he&rsquo;s most always up to,
and he hasn&rsquo;t been in to his meals for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he eaten for a week?&rdquo; asked Larry, in
some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless your heart, of course he&rsquo;s eaten,
but he will not come to the table. His wife has
to go out to the laboratory with a plate of victuals
and a cup of coffee, and fairly feed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you see he&rsquo;s working on a new invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort?&rdquo; asked Larry, thinking he might
get a story out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; cried the servant, with a
laugh, for she evidently took Larry for some boy
on an errand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about wheels and levers
and steam and electricity. As near as I can get
at, it&rsquo;s a plan to make an automobile out of a
tea kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I could see the professor?&rdquo;
asked the young reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can try,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;The laboratory
is that small white building down at the
far end of the yard. Go down there, and walk
right in. If you knock he&rsquo;ll never answer. Mrs.
Allen has just fed him his breakfast, and perhaps
he&rsquo;ll talk to you a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Larry decided this was the only way of securing
what he wanted, so he made his way to the
laboratory, and, remembering the injunction,
entered the door and walked in.</p>
<p>He found himself in a large room, fairly filled
with machinery and appliances of all kinds.
Overhead there were shafts and pulleys, while
all about the sides were benches, lathes, wheels,
levers, handles, and springs of various sorts.</p>
<p>Down in one corner was an elderly gentleman,
in rather an old and ragged suit, at work over
a bench. He did not look up as Larry entered,
but called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here and give me a hand with this. I&rsquo;m
in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry looked around to see if the professor
could be speaking to anyone else, but, finding
that he was the only one in the room besides the
scientist, the lad concluded he was the one addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, please,&rdquo; added Mr. Allen, looking
straight at Larry. &ldquo;I am in the midst of an important
experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Larry went to the bench. Mr.
Allen was holding one end of a long steel tube
from which radiated several smaller tubes of
glass. At one end of the steel tube was a rubber
pipe which was attached to a gas jet, and at the
other end of the tube there was another pipe
which was fastened to a water faucet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn on the gas a little more, and then help
me hold this tube,&rdquo; spoke the scientist. &ldquo;I am
generating steam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>He spoke as though it was the most natural
thing in the world for Larry to be there, and give
him assistance. Larry recognized that Mr. Allen
was too much absorbed in his experiment to care
who helped him, so the boy lent a hand.</p>
<p>Larry turned the gas on, and then grasped one
end of the tube. Mr. Allen held the other. There
was a curious rumbling sound, followed by a
roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck! She&rsquo;s going to explode again!&rdquo; cried
Mr. Allen, dropping his end of the tube, and
crawling under a table. Larry lost no time in
following his example. The next instant there
was a loud report, and pieces of the tube and
rubber hose were flying in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over, you can come out now,&rdquo; remarked
the scientist, in a quiet voice, a few seconds
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it often act that way?&rdquo; inquired Larry,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the twenty-seventh time it has blown
up,&rdquo; replied the professor. &ldquo;I guess the glass is
not strong enough for the steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous?&rdquo; ventured Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous? Of course it is! That&rsquo;s what
I expect in this business. But I have another
tube here, and we&rsquo;ll try it again. Just take your
coat off, and help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the New York <i>Daily Leader</i>.
I came to get a copy of your speech.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Allen, sharply.</p>
<p>Larry repeated his statement more fully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor. &ldquo;I
took you for my assistant&rsquo;s son. He often helps
me. I didn&rsquo;t get a good look at you, I was so
busy thinking about this steam problem. I hope
you were not hurt when the explosion came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! Father! Are you injured?&rdquo; cried
a voice, and a woman, much excited, hurried
into the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, my dear, not a bit,&rdquo; replied the professor,
as he brushed the dust from his clothes.
&ldquo;Another tube blew up, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and he seemed
as cheerful as though the experiment had succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those horrible, dangerous steam tubes!&rdquo;
exclaimed the lady. Then she saw Larry, and,
observing he was a stranger, was about to withdraw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a reporter from the New York
<i>Leader</i>,&rdquo; explained the scientist. &ldquo;He has come
for a copy of my speech, and it&rsquo;s a good thing he
did. I had forgotten all about delivering it to-night.
I guess I&rsquo;ll go in the house, and get
ready. Come with me,&rdquo; he added to Larry, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll get the copy for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness something happened to make
him come back to civilization,&rdquo; remarked the
lady to Larry, as they walked toward the house.
&ldquo;He has slept in that laboratory, and taken his
meals there ever since he started on this latest
idea. It&rsquo;s a good thing you came along, and
awakened him to some realization that there&rsquo;s
something in this world besides those terrible
steam tubes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the explosion did,&rdquo; ventured Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? It would take more than an explosion,&rdquo;
the lady, who was Mr. Allen&rsquo;s daughter,
replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s used to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry went into the house, where, after some
search, Mr. Allen found a copy of his remarks,
which he gave to the young reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out and see me again some day,&rdquo; the
scientist invited Larry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try that experiment
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid once is enough for me,&rdquo; said Larry,
with a smile.</p>
<p>He reached his office shortly after noon, and,
handing in the copy of the speech, which had
been gotten in advance, so as to be set up ready
for the next day&rsquo;s paper. Then he reported at
the desk, announcing to Mr. Emberg that he was
ready for another assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a run down to City Hall,&rdquo; said the city
editor. &ldquo;Mr. Newton is covering it to-day, but
he is busy on a story, and he telephoned in he had
no time to make all the rounds of the offices.
Just see if there are any routine matters he had
to overlook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>It was the first time Larry had ever been assigned
to the municipal building alone. He was
familiar with most of the offices and knew some
of the officials by sight, as Mr. Newton had frequently
taken him around to &ldquo;learn him the
ropes,&rdquo; as he said. So Larry felt not a little
elated, and began to dream of the time when he
might have important assignments, such as looking
after city matters and politics, matters to
which New York papers pay great attention.</p>
<p>Larry went into several offices at the hall, and
found there was no news. It was rather a dull
day along municipal and political lines, and there
were few reporters around the building. Larry
knew some of them, who nodded to him in a
friendly way, and asked him whether there was
&ldquo;anything new,&rdquo; a reporter&rsquo;s manner of inquiring
for news.</p>
<p>As Larry had nothing he said so, it being a
sort of unwritten law among newspaper men not
to beat each other on routine assignments, unless
there was some special story they were after.</p>
<p>It was almost closing hour at the hall, and
within a few minutes of the time the <i>Leader&rsquo;s</i>
last edition went to press, that Larry entered the
anteroom of the City Comptroller&rsquo;s office. He
hardly expected there would be any news, and
he knew if there was it was almost too late for
that day. However, he was tired, and, as there
were comfortable chairs in the office, he resolved
to have a few minutes&rsquo; rest, while waiting to
see the official or the chief clerk to ask if there
was anything new.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>It was while sitting there, with his chair tilted
back against a thin partition, that Larry overheard
voices in somewhat loud conversation. At
first he paid little attention to the matter. But
when one of the voices became quite loud he
could not help hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve got the whole plan outlined,
and we can all make big money by it,&rdquo; someone
remarked. &ldquo;I know the lay of the land. It&rsquo;s
up in the Bronx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Larry began to take some notice, as
he remembered he and his mother were interested
in some Bronx property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal is going through, then?&rdquo; asked another
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Larry had no intention of eavesdropping,
and, if he had thought the conversation was of a
private nature, he would have moved away. But
it seemed the men had nothing to conceal, for
they talked loudly. They were probably unaware
that a transom over the door of the room where
they were, was open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so sure the land will be valuable?&rdquo;
asked another voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know it,&rdquo; came the answer from
the one who had first spoken. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going
to be an ordinance introduced in the Common
Council soon. Now all we have to do is to buy
up all the lots&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; What followed was in a
low tone, and Larry could not hear. Then the
voice went on: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great game, for it will
take our votes to pass the ordinance, see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t there be some danger?&rdquo; asked someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. There&rsquo;s only one hitch. I&rsquo;ve been
looking the thing up, and I find that the most
valuable strip of land in the whole tract is owned
by some man up New York State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like Pexter or Wexter,&rdquo; was the
reply, whereat Larry felt his heart beating
strongly. Suppose it should happen to be the
land for which his mother held the deed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we put the deal through?&rdquo; several asked
of the man who was doing the most talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we can,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Alderman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud!&rdquo; cautioned a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close that transom,&rdquo; ordered someone, and
then Larry moved away, fearing the men might
come out, and find him listening. He wanted to
know more of the matter, for he felt sure some
underhanded game was afoot.</p>
<p>That afternoon, on the way home, Larry told
Mr. Newton of what he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s some sort of a deal on,&rdquo; said
the older reporter. &ldquo;Glad you happened to overhear
that, Larry. I&rsquo;ll get busy on the tip, and
maybe we can block the game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON A CHOWDER PARTY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little trip out of town for you,
Larry,&rdquo; said Mr. Emberg the next morning.
&ldquo;There will not be much work attached to it,
unless something unexpected happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of an assignment is it?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eighth Ward Democratic Club is going
to have an outing to Coney Island,&rdquo; replied the
city editor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clam chowder party, and,
while it is mainly to give the members of the
association a good time, there may be some politics
discussed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know much about politics,&rdquo;
answered Larry, somewhat doubtful of his ability
to cover that kind of an assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never learn any younger,&rdquo; was Mr.
Emberg&rsquo;s rejoinder, as he smiled at Larry. &ldquo;Get
me a good story of what the men do, and I guess
you&rsquo;ll not miss much. There are going to be
some games down at the beach, in the afternoon,
races and so on, that may make something funny
to write about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Emberg gave Larry a ticket to the chowder
outing, and told him where to take the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, kid,&rdquo; remarked one of the
older reporters, as he saw the &ldquo;cub&rdquo; start on his
assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s nothing to do except enjoy the
trip, eat a good dinner, and sit off in the shade
in the afternoon. It&rsquo;s one of the few decent
things we fall into in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I can get a good story that&rsquo;s all I
care about,&rdquo; responded Larry, who had not been
a reporter long enough to lose his early enthusiasm.
He was always looking for a chance to get
a good story, and no less on this occasion when
there was not much of an opportunity.</p>
<p>Larry made his way to the dock whence the
boat was to leave. He found a crowd of men at
the wharf, all of them wearing gaily-colored
badges, for the Eighth Ward Democratic Club
was one of the most influential and largest political
organizations in New York.</p>
<p>At the dock all was hurry and excitement. A
band was playing lively airs, and a number of fat
men were wiping the perspiration from their
brows, for it was August, and a hot day, and they
had marched half-way around the ward before
coming to the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Scores of men were piling good things to eat
on the boat, for political outings seem to be always
regarded as hungry affairs. Larry saw a
number of other reporters whom he knew slightly,
and spoke to them. Soon all the newspaper men
formed a crowd among themselves, and found a
comfortable place on the boat, where they sat
and talked &ldquo;shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older reporters discussed politics, and the
younger ones conversed about the assignments
they had recently covered. For, curiously
enough, though a reporter sees much of life of
various sorts that might furnish topics of conversation,
no sooner do two or more of them
get together than they begin discussions of matters
connected directly with their work. Perhaps
this is so because everything in life concerns
reporters, more or less.</p>
<p>Lunch was served on the boat when it was
about half-way to the Island, and Larry thought
he never had tasted anything so good, for the salt
air made him very hungry. Then such a dinner
as there was when the grove where the club held
its outings was reached.</p>
<p>There was a regular old-fashioned clam chowder
and clam-bake in preparation. First came
the chowder, which, instead of taking the edges
from sharp appetites, seemed only to increase
them. Then the members of the club and their
friends strolled about, sat under trees, or gathered
in little groups to talk, while the clam-bake
was being made ready.</p>
<p>Larry thought perhaps he had better go about,
and see if he could pick up any political tips. He
spoke about it to one of the other reporters, but
the latter said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, don&rsquo;t worry about that, Larry.
The only time when politics will crop out, if
they do at all, is after they&rsquo;ve had their dinners.
That will loosen their tongues, and we may pick
up something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Larry decided he might spend some time
watching the men prepare the clam-bake.</p>
<p>First they built a big fire of wood in a sort of
hollow in the ground. The blaze was so hot it
was most uncomfortable to go close to it, but the
cook and his assistants did not appear to mind it.
They put scores of stones in the blaze, and the
cobbles were soon glowing with the heat. Occasionally
one would crack, and the pieces flew
all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever get hit?&rdquo; asked Larry, of the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once or twice, but I&rsquo;m getting so I can dodge
&rsquo;em now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then came another crack, and the cook
ducked quickly, as a large piece of stone flew over
his head. He laughed, and Larry joined him.
When the stones were hot enough the men raked
away the charred wood and embers, and then
piled the stones up in a round heap. They were
so hot that the men had to use long-handled rakes
and pitchforks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>On top of the cobbles was thrown a quantity
of wet seaweed, which sent up a cloud of vapor.
Then the cook and his helpers began piling on
top of the steaming weed bushels of clams, scores
of lobsters, whole chickens, crabs, potatoes, corn
on the cob, and other things. Then the whole
mass was covered with more seaweed, and over
all a big canvas was spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, it will cook in about an hour,&rdquo;
said the cook, who seemed to have removed considerable
anxiety from his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you build more fire on it?&rdquo; asked Larry,
who had never been at a clam-bake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. The hot stones do all the cooking
now,&rdquo; responded the cook.</p>
<p>And so it proved, for in about an hour the
canvas was taken off, the weed removed, and
there the whole mass of victuals was cooked to
a turn. The men gathered around the table,
places were found for the reporters, and the feast
began. Larry ate so many clams, and so much
lobster and chicken, that he feared he would not
be able to hold a pencil to take notes, providing
anyone was left alive to write about. Everyone
seemed to be trying to outdo his neighbor in the
amount of food consumed.</p>
<p>But it was a healthful way in which to dine,
and no ill effects seemed to follow the clam-bake.
An hour&rsquo;s rest in the shade followed, and then it
was announced that the games would be started.</p>
<p>A sack race was the first on the programme,
and the contestants, of whom there were eight,
allowed themselves to be tied up in bags, which
reached to their necks. At the word they started
to waddle toward the goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>There was one very fat man and one thin one
who seemed to be doing better than any of the
others. They both took little steps inside the
bags, and were distancing their competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Fatty!&rdquo; called the stout man&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll win, Skinny!&rdquo; shouted the advocates
of the tall, thin one.</p>
<p>The latter began to forge ahead, and, it seemed,
would win the race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down and roll!&rdquo; shouted someone to the
fat man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s a good ideaness!&rdquo; answered the fleshy
contestant, who spoke with a strong German accent.</p>
<p>He fell upon his knees, and then toppled over
on his side on the green grass over which the
course was laid. There was a general laugh,
most persons thinking the man had fallen, and
was out of the race. But not so with the fleshy
one. He began rolling over and over, his rotundity
and the soft sod preventing him from
being hurt. He kept his head away from the
ground, and, so rapidly did he revolve that, inside
of two minutes he had passed the thin man.
The latter in his efforts to come in first took too
long steps, his feet got tangled up inside the sack,
and he went sprawling on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vins!&rdquo; exclaimed the German, as he rolled
over for the last time, and bumped into the goal
post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t win fair!&rdquo; cried the thin man, trying
to talk with his mouth filled with grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shure I dit!&rdquo; the fleshy one exclaimed.
&ldquo;Vat&rsquo;s der rules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, he wins under the rules,&rdquo; announced
the man in charge of the games. &ldquo;Contestants
could walk, run, or roll. Fatty wins and
gets the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot iss dot prize?&rdquo; asked the German, while
some of his friends took him out of the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beautiful medal,&rdquo; replied the man in
charge, and he handed the winner a large one
made of leather, on which was burned a picture
of a donkey. There was a burst of laughter, in
which the butt of the joke had to join.</p>
<p>After this came a potato race, in which each
contestant had to carry the tubers one at a time,
in a spoon, and the one who brought the most to
the goal received five dollars. Following there
was a wheelbarrow contest, in which the smallest
members of the club were obliged to wheel the
largest and fattest ones. It was hard on the thin
men, but the others appeared to enjoy it.</p>
<p>A swimming race to see who could catch a
greased duck caused lots of fun. The men put
on bathing suits, and scores of them went into
the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t some of you reporters want to join the
sport?&rdquo; asked one of the entertainment committee.
Some of the newspaper men did, and said
so. Larry resolved to enter, for he was a good
swimmer. Soon he had borrowed a suit, and was
splashing around with the others. All was in
readiness for the contest. The duck was released
at the far side of a small cove, the swimmers
starting from the opposite shore.</p>
<p>Such shouting, laughing, splashing, and sport
as there was! Half the men had no intention of
catching the duck, but, instead, took the opportunity
of ducking some of their companions under
water. Larry had no idea of catching the
fowl, since he saw several men try, and lose their
grip because of the oil on the duck&rsquo;s feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars to whoever catches the bird!&rdquo;
shouted a man on shore, watching the struggle.
At this there was a general rush for the unfortunate
fowl. She was caught once or twice, but
managed to slip away, leaving a few feathers
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to catch her,&rdquo; said Larry to himself.
He waited a good opportunity when the
duck was in a comparatively free space in the
water. Then Larry began swimming slowly
toward her. The duck did not see him approaching,
and was paddling about. When about ten
feet away Larry dived, and began swimming under
water. He rose right under the duck, grabbed
the fowl by the legs, and held her fast, swimming
toward shore with his free arm.</p>
<p>A cheer greeted him as he waded out with the
prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your money!&rdquo; exclaimed the man
who offered it, handing Larry a five-dollar gold
piece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MAN OVERBOARD!</span></h2>
<p>Several other reporters gathered about Larry,
who stood blushing at the attention he was attracting.
He hardly knew whether to accept the
money or not. One of his fellow newspaper workers
saw his confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the game,
and you won it fairly. I&rsquo;ll keep it for you until
you get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry accepted the offer, and gave the money
to his friend, who put it in his pocket until the
lad had his clothes on once more.</p>
<p>There were a number of other games and
sports after this, and then the members of the
club, thoroughly tired out with the day&rsquo;s fun,
went aboard the boat for the trip home. There
was not much excitement on the way back, and
Larry was beginning to fear he might have
missed the story.</p>
<p>He thought perhaps there had been politics
talked which he had not overheard, and he was
worried lest Mr. Emberg would think he had not
properly covered the assignment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Larry ventured to hint at this to some of the
other reporters, but they all told him that, contrary
to all expectations, there had been no politics
worth mentioning discussed on the outing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just make a general story of it,&rdquo; advised the
reporter who had held the money for Larry.
&ldquo;None of us are looking for a beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Larry made his mind easier. A little later
the boat made a stop at a dock to let off several
members who had decided to go the rest of the
way home by train. The newspaper men, with
the exception of Larry, decided, also, to go home
on the railroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come along,&rdquo; they said to Larry.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no more story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; rejoined Larry, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll stay
just the same. The boss told me to keep on the
job until it was over, and it isn&rsquo;t over until the
boat ties up at the last dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get over that nonsense,&rdquo; said the
reporter, with a laugh, as he left the craft. The
boat resumed her way up the river, and Larry,
who was quite tired out, was beginning to think
he was to have his trouble for his pains in explicitly
following instructions. There seemed no
more chance for news, since most of the men
were resting comfortably in chairs, or lounging
half-asleep in the cabins. Even the band was too
tired to play.</p>
<p>It was getting dusk, and Larry was wondering
what time he would get home. He walked about
the upper deck, and gazed off across the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Suddenly there sounded a commotion on the
deck below him. Then came a splash in the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man overboard! Man overboard!&rdquo; sung out
several deckhands. &ldquo;Lower a boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the steamer was the scene of confusion.
Men were running to and fro, a hurried
jangle of bells came from the engine room, and
the craft slackened speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn on the searchlight!&rdquo; cried someone, and
soon the beams from the big glaring beacon were
gleaming on the dark waters aft the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is, I see his head!&rdquo; cried someone
at the stern, casting a life buoy toward the figure
of the man who had toppled over the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw him in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were a few of the confused cries that
came from all parts of the steamer. But while
most of the excursionists were greatly excited, the
members of the crew of the craft remained calm.
They quickly lowered a boat, and, by the aid of
the glare from the searchlight, were able to pick
out the swimming figure of the man. They
headed the boat toward him, and in a little while
hauled him into the small skiff. Then they rowed
back to the steamer, the rail of which was
crowded with anxious friends of the unlucky
one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you save him?&rdquo; they cried, for they could
not see whether their friend was in the boat or
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried several of the crew, and one
added: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all the better for a little salt water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make a good part of the story,&rdquo;
thought Larry, as he watched the craft drawing
nearer. &ldquo;I guess the other fellows will wish they
had stayed aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the skiff reached the steamer, and the
crew, and rescued one, had been taken aboard,
there were scores of demands to know how it all
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the victim of the accident.
&ldquo;I was sleeping on two camp-stools close to the
rail. I got to dreaming I was making a political
speech, and I was walking up and down the platform
telling the audience what a fine party the
Democratic one is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have walked a little too far, for, the
first thing I knew, I had stepped over the edge
of the platform, and the next thing I knew I was
falling. I woke up in the river, and struck out.
That&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for you the searchlight was working,&rdquo;
remarked one of the man&rsquo;s friends, &ldquo;or you
might have been on the bottom of the river by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said the man, with a smile,
as he wiped the water from his eyes. &ldquo;I ate so
many clams, lobsters, and crabs to-day that when
I got down there the river thought I was a sort
of a fish, and so it didn&rsquo;t drown me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry made inquiry, and found out the man&rsquo;s
name. He made notes of the occurrence, and,
the next morning, on reaching the office, wrote
up a lively story of the happening.</p>
<p>He said nothing to Mr. Emberg about being
the only reporter on the boat when the thing happened.
But that afternoon, when all the other
papers came out, and, like the morning issues,
had no account of the rescue of the man, who
was a prominent politician, the city editor said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you weren&rsquo;t &lsquo;faking&rsquo; that story,
Larry?&rdquo; and Mr. Emberg looked serious, for he
did not want any of the reporters to &ldquo;fake,&rdquo; or
write untrue accounts of matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it actually happened,&rdquo; said Larry,
and he related how he came to be the only newspaper
reporter at the scene. A little later Mr.
Newton came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did we have a story of a
man falling overboard on that Democratic outing?
I just heard of it on the street as I was
coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not been in that morning, being out
of town on a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Larry was on hand as usual,&rdquo; replied the
city editor, for by this time he was convinced
that Larry&rsquo;s account was true. &ldquo;He has given us
another beat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>And so it proved, for the <i>Leader</i> was the only
paper in New York that had an account of the
incident, and nearly all of the later editions of
the afternoon sheets had to use the story, copying
it from the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good beat, and a good story of the
outing besides,&rdquo; said Mr. Emberg, shortly after
the last edition had gone to press, for he liked
the half-humorous manner in which Larry had
written about the sack race and the other sports
in which the members of the club had indulged.
&ldquo;You are doing fine work,&rdquo; he added, at which
praise Larry felt much gratified.</p>
<p>Things were slacking up a bit in the office, now
that the paper had gone to press for the day,
when one of the reporters who was looking over
the front page suddenly cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bad mistake in that account of the
meeting of the County Republican Committee
last night. It says Jones voted for Smith for
chairman, and that&rsquo;s wrong. I was there. The
compositor must have made a mistake. It ought
to be corrected, or it will make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Emberg,
as he grabbed a paper to see the error.
&ldquo;The presses are running, and part of the last
edition is off. The only way we can do is to
have them smash Jones&rsquo;s name, and blur it so no
one can tell what it is. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore part of the page off, marked out the
name to be smashed, and called to Larry, there
being no copy boys in the room then:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Larry, go down in the pressroom, and
tell Dunn, the foreman, to smash that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Larry had been on the paper some
time he had never been in the pressroom. Nor
did he know what the operation of smashing a
name might mean, but he decided the best thing
to do would be to carry the message.</p>
<p>He hurried down to the basement. As soon
as he opened the door leading to it, down a steep
flight of steps, Larry thought he had gotten into
a boiler factory by mistake. The noise was
deafening, and the presses were thundering away
like some giant machine grinding tons of rocks
to atoms.</p>
<p>Half-naked men were running about here and
there. In one corner was a furnace full of melted
lead for making the stereotype plates. Larry
made his way through the maze of wheels, machinery,
and presses.</p>
<p>He was met by a youth whose face was covered
with ink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Dunn?&rdquo; asked Larry, shouting
at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>The youth did not bother to answer in words.
He had been in the pressroom long enough to
know the uselessness of trying to make himself
heard above the din. He had understood Larry&rsquo;s
question from watching his lips, and pointed over
in one corner.</p>
<p>There Larry found a quiet man marking something
in a book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Emberg says to smash that name!&rdquo; yelled
the boy, handing over the paper. He was afraid
he had not made himself heard, but Mr. Dunn
seemed to comprehend, for he nodded several
times, though he did not seem pleased. He hated
to stop the presses, once they were running, until
all the edition was off.</p>
<p>However, it had to be done. He left his corner,
and went around the rear of the ponderous
machine, where the paper, in a large roll, was
fed in at one end, to emerge, folded and printed
sheets, at the other. Mr. Dunn seized a rope, and
yanked it. A bell rang, and the press began to
slacken up.</p>
<p>The type from which the paper was printed
was cast in one solid sheet, there being several
of the sheets, just the size of a page. Each one
was half-circular, and fitted around a cylinder on
the press. This cylinder whirled around, and
the paper, passing under it in a continuous roll,
received the impressions.</p>
<p>Once the press was stopped Mr. Dunn crawled
up into a sort of hole in front of the cylinder,
Then he had the press worked slowly, until
the particular page he had to reach came into
view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Next, with a hammer and chisel he smashed
the name of Jones so that it was a meaningless
blur. After that the press started its thundering
again. The remainder of the papers would not
contain the name of Jones, and so there would
be no danger of that gentleman coming in and
demanding an apology for a misstatement made
about him. Often papers have to resort to this
emergency when it is too late to correct directly
in type an error that has been made.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">LARRY IN DANGER</span></h2>
<p>When Larry was eating supper that night he
happened to glance out of the window. He saw
an unusual light in the sky, and first took it for a
glow from some gas furnace or smelting works
across on the Jersey shore. But, as he watched,
the light grew more brilliant, and there was a
cloud of smoke and a shower of sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jumping up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to it, are you, Larry?&rdquo;
asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Most of
the men are working to-night, and none of them
may go to the blaze. If we want a good story
we must be right on the spot. So I think I&rsquo;ll
go, though I may find Mr. Newton or someone
else covering it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be careful, and don&rsquo;t go too near,&rdquo; cautioned
Mrs. Dexter, who was quite nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for myself,&rdquo; said Larry, with all
the assurance lads usually have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to the fire, I&rsquo;ll help you report it,&rdquo;
begged Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; answered Larry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably
a good way off, and you&rsquo;d get tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can carry me,&rdquo; spoke the little fellow,
ready to cry at not being allowed to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here, and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story,&rdquo;
promised Lucy, who had grown to be a strong,
healthy girl since the surgical operation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you about Jack the Giant Killer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you truly?&rdquo; cried Jimmy. &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t
care about the old fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He climbed up into his sister&rsquo;s lap, and soon
was deeply interested in the story. Larry got
on his hat and coat, and started out on the run.
He found a big crowd in the street, hurrying
toward the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s a gas tank,&rdquo; said someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it was an armory,&rdquo; remarked another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neither; it&rsquo;s a big hotel, and about a hundred
people are burned to death,&rdquo; put in a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s surely a big fire,&rdquo; was a
fourth man&rsquo;s response as he started to run.</p>
<p>Larry wanted to get to the fire in a hurry, so
he asked the first policeman he met where the
blaze was. Learning that it was well up town,
though the glare in the sky made it seem nearer,
Larry decided to get on an elevated train to save
a long walk.</p>
<p>As he neared the scene he could see the sky
growing brighter, and the cloud of smoke increasing
in volume. The trail of sparks across
the heavens became larger. Down in the street
an ever-increasing throng was hastening toward
the conflagration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Larry dashed from the train as it slacked up
at the station nearest the fire. He ran down the
stairs, and through the streets. As he came into
view of the blaze he saw it was a big drygoods
store, which was a mass of fire. It evidently had
secured a good start, as every window was belching
tongues of yellow flame.</p>
<p>Larry found a crowd of policemen lined up
some distance away from the conflagration, keeping
people back of the fire lines. Fortunately Larry
had a newspaper badge with him, and the sight
of this, with a statement that he was from the
<i>Leader</i>, soon gained him admittance within the
cordon.</p>
<p>He could not but think of the first time he had
been at a fire in New York, how he had helped
Mr. Newton, and, incidentally, got his place on
the paper.</p>
<p>But there was no time for idle speculation.
The fire was making rapid headway, and, in response
to a third and fourth alarm that the chief
had sent in, several more engines were thundering
up, and taking their places near water hydrants,
their whistles screeching shrilly, and the
horses prancing and dancing on the stones from
which their iron-shod hoofs struck sparks in profusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Larry made a quick circle of the building,
which occupied an entire block, but failed to see
any reporters from the <i>Leader</i>. He knew it was
only chance that would bring them to the place,
since most of them had assignments in different
parts of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to cover this all alone,&rdquo;
thought Larry. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s going to be a big job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, it was one of the worst and largest
fires New York ever had. It was no small task
for several reporters to cover it, and for a young
and inexperienced one to undertake it was almost
out of the question. But Larry decided that he
would do his best.</p>
<p>He went at it in a business-like way, noting
the size and general shape of the building, and
how the fire was spreading. Then he found how
many engines were on hand, and from a group of
policemen, who had nothing in particular to do
except keep the throng back, Larry learned that
the fire had been discovered in the basement about
half an hour before. One of the bluecoats told
how two janitors in the place had been obliged to
slide down a rope, as they were caught by the
flames on a side of the building where there were
no fire escapes.</p>
<p>Larry got the names of the men from a policeman
whose beat took in the store, and who
knew them. Then he heard of several other interesting
details, which he jotted down. All the
while he was hoping some other <i>Leader</i> men
would happen along to aid him, and relieve him
of some responsibility. But none came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The store was now a raging furnace. The
whole scene was one of magnificent if terrible
splendor. High in the air shot a shower of
sparks, and every now and then a wall would
fall in with a crash that sounded loud above the
puffing of the engines, the shrill tootings of the
whistles, and the hoarse cries of the firemen.</p>
<p>With a rattle louder than any of the apparatus
that had preceded it, the water tower dashed up.
It had been sent for when the chief saw that
with the ordinary machines he would be unable
to cope with the raging flames.</p>
<p>Under the power of compressed air the tower
rose high, a long, thin tube of steel. Hose lines
from several steamers were quickly attached, and
the engines began pumping.</p>
<p>Out of the end of the tube shot a powerful
stream of water that fairly tore out part of a side
wall it was directed against, and spurted in on the
forked tongues that were leaping up from the
seething caldron of fire. A cheer went up from
the big crowd that gathered as they saw the water
tower come into play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll soon settle the fire!&rdquo; cried one man,
on the sidewalk, near where the young reporter
was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take more than one tower to put out
this blaze,&rdquo; rejoined a companion. &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s
spreading.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Others seemed to think so, too, for there were
a number of quick orders from the chief, and his
assistants ran to execute them. Two more water
towers were soon on the scene, and then the fire
seemed to be in a fair way of being put under
control.</p>
<p>Larry was busy going from one side to the
other of the big block which the burning department
store occupied. He saw several incidents
that he made notes of, knowing they would add
interest to the story he hoped to write.</p>
<p>On the north side of the structure there loomed
a big blank wall, that as yet had not succumbed
to the flames. A number of firemen were standing
near the base of it, endeavoring to break a
hole through so they might get a stream of water
on the flames from that side, since to get a ladder
to the top of the wall was impossible, as the
flames were raging at the upper edge.</p>
<p>Larry paused to watch them. Fierce blows
were struck at the masonry with sledges and axes.
Pieces of bricks and mortar flew all about. The
men had made a small hole, which they were
rapidly enlarging when a hoarse voice cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back! back, men! For your lives! The wall
is coming down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire-fighters needed no second warning.
They dropped their implements, and sprang back.
Then with a crash that sounded like an explosion,
the entire wall toppled over into the street.</p>
<p>Several of the firemen were caught under the
d&eacute;bris, and pinned down. Their cries for help
brought scores of their comrades up on the run,
and Larry pressed forward to see all there was, in
order to put it into the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; called a policeman guarding the
fire lines. &ldquo;More danger overhead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as he spoke, a big piece of masonry
toppled down, and landed in the street not two
feet from where Larry was standing, peering forward
to see how the firemen fared. If it had
struck him he would have been killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, men!&rdquo; called an assistant chief.
&ldquo;Go slow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care for the danger! We&rsquo;re going
to get the boys out!&rdquo; cried several of the unfortunate
men&rsquo;s comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead, I guess most of the wall&rsquo;s
down now,&rdquo; spoke the assistant chief. &ldquo;Here,
you, young man!&rdquo; he called to Larry. &ldquo;What
you doing here? Don&rsquo;t you know you nearly
got killed then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Larry, trying to speak
calmly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a reporter, and I have to stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a reporter, eh?&rdquo; asked the fireman,
as he started in to help his men. &ldquo;Well, I suppose
you think you&rsquo;re like a cat, and have nine
lives, but you&rsquo;d better be careful! Now get back
a bit, while we see if any of these poor fellows
are alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry got some distance away, though not so
far but that he could see what was going on. The
crowd on this side had increased in size as the
word went around that several firemen were buried
in the ruins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The rescuers worked madly, tearing at the hot
bricks with picks and shovels. With crowbars
they pried apart big masses of masonry. The
lurid flames lighted up the scene with dancing
tongues of fire, and the cries of the wounded
mingled with the crackle of the blaze, the toots
of the engines, and the hoarse yells of the men.</p>
<p>With loudly clanging bells several ambulances
now drew up opposite where the imprisoned men
were. They had been telephoned for as soon as
it was known that an accident had occurred. After
several minutes&rsquo; work one of the firemen was
taken out. The white-suited doctor hurried to
his side, and bent over the man. He listened to
his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; said the physician. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something like a groan went up from the unfortunate
fellow&rsquo;s comrades. It was quickly succeeded
by a cheer, however, as another man was
brought out. This one was very much alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be jabbers, b&rsquo;ys!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in jolly Irish
accents, &ldquo;it was a hot place ye took me from,
more power t&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; and, wiggling out of the hold
of his rescuers, the fireman began dancing a jig
in the light of the flames.</p>
<p>In quick succession half a dozen more were
taken out. There were no more dead bodies, but
several of the men were badly hurt, and were
hurried off to the hospitals. Larry got their
names from other firemen, and jotted them down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LARRY HAS AN OFFER</span></h2>
<p>The young reporter had almost forgotten
about his narrow escape, so anxious was he to
get a good account of the fire, when he was surprised
to hear a voice at his side saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to get all the good stories
that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry looked up, and saw Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, but I&rsquo;m glad to see you!&rdquo; said Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear about you nearly getting
caught under a wall?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton. &ldquo;A
policeman told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I was
trying to get close to where the accident happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing as getting too close,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Newton, grimly. &ldquo;Get the news,
and don&rsquo;t be afraid, but don&rsquo;t go poking your
head into the lion&rsquo;s mouth. You can take it
easier now. I&rsquo;m going to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know I was here?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Mr. Emberg heard of the fire, and telephoned
me I had better cover it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;most over now,&rdquo; observed Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton, as he noted
that the flames were dying out under the dampening
influence of tons of water poured on them.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the best part of it. I suppose it
will make a good story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I only hope I can
write it up in good shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can, all right,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you. Perhaps you had better
go home now, as your mother might be worried
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry agreed that this was a good plan, and
made his way through the crowd to a car, which
he boarded for his home, arriving somewhat after
midnight.</p>
<p>His mother was sitting up waiting for him,
and was somewhat alarmed at his absence, as rumors
of the big fire had spread downtown, and
it was said that a number had been killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you were not hurt, Larry,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;I hope you were in no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; replied Larry, for he did
not think it well to tell his mother how nearly
he had been hurt.</p>
<p>When Mr. Emberg learned the next day that
Larry had, without being particularly assigned to
it, covered the big fire, the city editor was much
pleased. He praised the lad highly, and said he
appreciated what Larry had done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The young reporter had his hands full that
day writing an account of the fire. Mr. Newton
gave him some help, but the story, in the main,
was Larry&rsquo;s, with some corrections the copy
readers made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story to be proud of,&rdquo; said Mr. Emberg,
when the last edition had gone to press. &ldquo;You
are doing well, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon, several days later, when Larry
had been sent to the City Hall to get some information
about a report the municipal treasurer
was about to submit, the boy was standing in the
corridor, having telephoned the story in. He saw
a short, dark-complexioned man, with a heavy
black mustache walking up and down the marble-paved
hall. Several times the stranger stopped,
and peered at Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he will recognize me when he sees me
again,&rdquo; thought the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Larry,&rdquo; called a reporter on another
paper, as he came from the tax office, where he
had been in search of a possible story. &ldquo;Anything
good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I was down on that
yarn about the treasurer&rsquo;s report. You got that,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we got that. Nothing else, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. I&rsquo;m just holding down
the job until Mr. Newton gets back. He went
out to get a bite to eat, and they didn&rsquo;t like to
leave the Hall uncovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you can hold it down all right,&rdquo;
replied the other. &ldquo;That was a good story of the
fire that you wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; answered Larry, as his friend went
away.</p>
<p>All this time the dark-complexioned stranger
was walking up and down the corridor. Finally
he came up to Larry, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your name Larry Dexter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the <i>Leader</i>, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the paper. Why, have you got a
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the man, with a short laugh.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deal in stories, but I see you&rsquo;re wide
awake, always on the lookout for &rsquo;em, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to get into some other
line of business?&rdquo; asked the man, coming closer,
and dropping his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>Larry thought the proceeding rather a strange
one, but imagined the man might not intend anything
more than a friendly interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on what sort of business,&rdquo; replied
the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like reporting very much?&rdquo; the
stranger went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather hard work and poor pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard work sometimes, and then
again it isn&rsquo;t. As for the pay, I guess I get all
I&rsquo;m worth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a position to get you a better job,&rdquo;
the man continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a big real estate
firm, the Universal we call it, and we need a
bright boy. I have some friends in the City Hall
here, some of the aldermen, and they said you
would be a good lad for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the aldermen ever heard
of me,&rdquo; remarked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ve been around the Hall a
good bit,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;You were at the
insurance hearing, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried copy for one of the reporters,&rdquo; said
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; resumed the stranger, &ldquo;do
you think you&rsquo;d like to work in a real estate office?
There&rsquo;s plenty of chances to make money,
besides what we would pay you as a salary. We
could give you twenty dollars a week to start.
How would that strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry was puzzled how to answer. The pay
was five dollars a week more than he was getting,
and if the man told the truth about the
chance to make extra money, it might mean a
good deal to the lad and his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; said the young reporter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to talk with my mother about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen your mother, and she says it&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; the man said, quickly. &ldquo;If you want to
you can come with me now, and I&rsquo;ll start you
in at once. You&rsquo;d better come. The offer is a
good one, and I can&rsquo;t hold it open long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Now Larry, though rather young, was inclined
to be cautious. It seemed strange that a man,
whom, as far as the reporter knew, he had never
seen before, should take such a sudden interest
in him, and should even go to see Mrs. Dexter to
ask if Larry could take another position. Then,
too, the stranger seemed altogether too eager to
get Larry to leave his position on the <i>Leader</i>.
The man saw Larry&rsquo;s hesitancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it twenty-five dollars a week,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Better come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide right away,&rdquo; the boy returned.
&ldquo;I must see my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt my word?&rdquo; asked the stranger
somewhat angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;But even if my mother
gave her permission I could not leave the <i>Leader</i>
without giving some notice to Mr. Emberg. It
would not be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; sneered the man.
&ldquo;They would never bother about giving you notice
if they wanted you to leave. They&rsquo;d fire
you in a second, if it suited them. Why should
you give any notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man appeared so eager, and seemed to
place so much importance on Larry&rsquo;s taking the
offer, that the boy became more suspicious than
ever, that all was not as it should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will think it over,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If you will
leave me your card I&rsquo;ll write to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take the offer at once I can&rsquo;t
hold it open,&rdquo; said the man, in rather unpleasant
tones. &ldquo;However, here&rsquo;s my card. If you come
to your senses, and decide to work for my company,
why, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for you. Though
I can&rsquo;t promise anything after to-day. You&rsquo;ll
have to take your chance with others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be willing to do that if I decide to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Larry!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice, and Mr.
Newton came around the corner of the corridor.
&ldquo;You here yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was waiting for you to come back,&rdquo; replied
Larry. &ldquo;Mr. Emberg told me to stay, and see
that nothing broke loose while you were at
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo; Larry turned to see if the
stranger was at his side, but, to his surprise, the
man had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton, with
a nod of his head toward where the man had been
standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he wanted me to leave the <i>Leader</i>, and
take a position with some real estate firm,&rdquo; answered
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have anything to do with Sam
Perkins,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his name?&rdquo; inquired Larry. Then
he looked at the card the man had given him, and
read on it: &ldquo;Samuel Perkins, representing the
Universal Real Estate Co. Main Office, 1144
Broadway, New York. Loans and Commissions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who he is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;What was his game this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was trying to puzzle out,&rdquo;
was Larry&rsquo;s answer, as he related what the man
had said.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton listened carefully. He nodded
his head several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie. When you go
home ask your mother just what Perkins said,
and let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you think there is something wrong
in his offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. I have my suspicions, but I&rsquo;ll
not speak of them until I know more. Tell me
what your mother says. In the meanwhile, if
Perkins comes to you again, which I don&rsquo;t think
he will, since he has seen me speaking to you,
just put him off until you can communicate with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him? I guess yes!&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;He was mixed up in more than one boodle
and land scandal with the aldermen, but we never
could get enough evidence to convict him. Maybe
we can this time, if he&rsquo;s up to any of his tricks.
Don&rsquo;t forget to ask your mother all about his
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; replied Larry. Then, as the
City Hall was about to close for the day, they
went back to the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE AGENT&rsquo;S PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>That night Larry questioned his mother
closely about the visit Mr. Perkins said he had
paid her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter,
in telling her story. &ldquo;He came to the door, and
asked if you were my son. Then he said a reporter&rsquo;s
life was a hard one, and asked me if I
didn&rsquo;t think you had better get a position somewhere
else. I thought he was a friend of yours,
and when he said he could give you a good job
in the real estate office I thought it would be a
good thing, and said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pretty nearly. He did ask a few questions
about your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he wanted to know where we came
from, where we used to live, and whether your
father ever owned any land here in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I didn&rsquo;t know much about it, but that
I thought your father had some papers, a deed
or something, to some property in the Bronx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say much, only he appeared to be
interested. He wanted to see the deed, but I
couldn&rsquo;t find it. I remember we had it one night,
and I told him I thought we burned it up.
Didn&rsquo;t we destroy it, Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to, but, don&rsquo;t you remember,
I said it might be a good thing to save?&rdquo; said
Larry. &ldquo;I have it put away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had known it,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Dexter.
&ldquo;I would have shown it to the man. He
seemed very much interested in you, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether too much,&rdquo; went on Larry.
&ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t trust that man. Mr. Newton
knows him, and says he is almost as bad a criminal
as though he had been convicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure he seemed real polite,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Dexter. &ldquo;He was very nicely spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the worst kind,&rdquo; said Larry.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever show him any of father&rsquo;s old papers,
particularly the deed to the land in the Bronx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Larry? Is there any chance of
that land ever becoming valuable? I remember
your poor father saying it would never be any
good. He was always sure he would never get
any money out of it, as it is in the middle of a
swamp. Do you think it will make us rich,
Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that, mother. In fact, it may never
amount to anything. I doubt if we have even a
good claim to it, as I don&rsquo;t believe the taxes have
been paid for a number of years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then what good is it to keep the deed? Don&rsquo;t
land go to the city if you don&rsquo;t pay taxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. In fact, I guess it always does.
But there is some mystery about this, mother.
I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I am going to find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope there is nothing wrong about us
having the deed, Larry. I&rsquo;m sure if your poor
father knew there was anything wrong about it,
he would never have taken the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not likely to be anything wrong, as
far as we are concerned,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;But,
from two or three things that have happened
lately, I am sure there is a mystery connected
with that land. In some way we are involved,
because we hold the deed. I am going to tell
Mr. Newton all about it, and perhaps he can help
us straighten it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fine if the land turned out
to be a gold mine,&rdquo; put in Jimmy, who was listening
with wide-opened eyes to what his mother
and brother were talking of, and only dimly comprehending
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; diamonds and ice cream mines,&rdquo; put in
Mary, who was staying up past her bedtime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fine,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;But I think
it is more likely to be a sandbank. In fact, I
think the sandman has been around here lately,
and has been throwing some of his dust in someone&rsquo;s
eyes,&rdquo; and he caught Mary up in his arms,
and kissed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sand in my eyes,&rdquo; said Jimmy,
rubbing them violently, to prove the contrary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, it&rsquo;s getting late; it&rsquo;s after nine o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Dexter. &ldquo;Time you children
were in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undress Mary,&rdquo; said Lucy, laying aside
her sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to undress myself,&rdquo; put in Jimmy,
who was growing to be quite a lad.</p>
<p>Soon the two children were in the land of nod,
and Lucy returned to the sitting-room, where
her mother and brother were still talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think this man had some hidden
motive?&rdquo; asked Lucy of her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it; or else why should he be so
persistent? He evidently wanted to get possession
of the deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think he offered you such a good
position?&rdquo; went on Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably wanted to get me into his office,
and then have me give him the deed, under pretense
of examining it. Once he had it I guess
we would never see it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a strange affair,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter,
with a sigh. &ldquo;I hope it will be explained soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will, sooner or later,&rdquo; spoke Larry, with
a confidence he hardly felt.</p>
<p>When Larry met Mr. Newton the next day,
and told the older reporter about the conversation
Perkins had had with Mrs. Dexter, Mr.
Newton said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things are working out the way I expected.
Now, Larry, my boy, we must say nothing, and
saw wood, as they say in France. If this thing
pans out it will be one of the biggest deals ever
undertaken. There may be something in it for
your family, and there certainly will be a big
story in it for the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must keep very quiet. If it leaks out
that we suspect something, or that we are on the
track of the men I believe to be behind the matter,
we will lose everything. So, first of all,
guard that deed carefully. Next, tell your mother
to hold no conversation with men who may call
at the house to inquire about your father&rsquo;s affairs.
Lastly, do no talking yourself on this subject.
I will work hard to stop the game I suspect
they are trying to play, but I feel I need your
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it involves the land my father
owns, or at least the land for which we have a
deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost certain of it. If it is what I believe,
there is much money in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; asked the lad. &ldquo;I hope some of
it will come my way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, part of it may,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;But the men back of it intend the main
share for themselves and the boodle aldermen
and land sharps associated with them. So be on
your guard, Larry. We can&rsquo;t have you kidnapped
again,&rdquo; and Mr. Newton smiled at the
recollection of the fate that once befell Larry in
the early stages of his work for the <i>Leader</i>, in
connection with the cab strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch out,&rdquo; replied the young reporter.</p>
<p>Larry had plenty to do that day, and, having
an afternoon assignment to cover&mdash;a meeting of
one of the city boards&mdash;he did not reach home
until rather later than usual. As he entered the
apartment he heard his mother conversing with
someone in the parlor, and the voice of the visitor
was a strange one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; the man was saying, &ldquo;I
assure you everything is open and above board.
We are making you an exceptionally good offer
for very poor land. In fact, if I had my way, the
purchase would not be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why talk of it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dexter.
&ldquo;I am not anxious to sell. In fact, I know very
little about the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A client of mine has taken a fancy to the
place,&rdquo; went on the man, while Larry listened,
wondering who it could be. &ldquo;He has authorized
me to offer you two thousand dollars for the
Bronx property. That is four times what it is
worth, but I want to please my friend. Will
you accept my offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she will not!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, entering
the room at that moment. &ldquo;Who are you, to
come here making offers for land?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it concerns you,&rdquo; replied
the stranger, in no gentle tones. &ldquo;What right
have you to interfere when I am talking to this
lady?&rdquo; He evidently took Larry for a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my son,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter, for she
did not like the man&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the stranger,
who seemed at a loss what to say. &ldquo;I did not
know him. You are Larry, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name. What is your business with
my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man appeared ill at ease. He twisted
about on the chair, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you decide to take that offer a friend of
mine in the real estate business made? I called
to see if you had, and I was talking to your
mother about it. Incidentally I mentioned that
I could sell some property I hear she owns up in
the Bronx. It is a small matter, hardly worth
my while to bother with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d advise you not to bother with it,&rdquo;
spoke Larry, shortly. &ldquo;We can look after our
own affairs, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face flushed, and he seemed very
angry. Then Larry remembered Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
advice to be careful of what he did or said in
connection with the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s very good of you to think of
my mother and myself,&rdquo; said Larry, a little more
politely. &ldquo;But we have not decided what to do
about that land, and I have made up my mind
to stay on the <i>Leader</i>, so you may tell your
friend I cannot accept his offer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better think twice before you refuse
my offer for the land,&rdquo; the man went on.
&ldquo;As I said, it is of no value, particularly, but a
friend of mine wants it. I might even offer you
twenty-five hundred dollars for it, but that is as
high as I can go. Will you take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied Larry, motioning to his
mother to make no answer.</p>
<p>The reply seemed to make the man more angry
than ever, and Larry could see him clench
his fist, and grit his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind letting me see the deed?&rdquo;
the stranger asked. &ldquo;It is possible I have made
a mistake, and that the land I am after is not
that which you own. A glance at the deed will
set me right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we can&rsquo;t let you see the deed,&rdquo;
spoke Larry. &ldquo;I have been told to take good
care of it, and not to let strangers have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I only want to glance at it,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you see it,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this,&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;In less than a month you&rsquo;ll be glad to take five
dollars for the place, that is, provided you own
it, which I very much doubt. You&rsquo;ll lose the land,
and then you&rsquo;ll wish you had taken my offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said Larry, firmly. &ldquo;We
will not show you the deed, nor sell you the land
at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can take the consequences,&rdquo;
snapped the man, as he went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BIG SAFE-ROBBERY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Larry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter, when the
sound of the stranger&rsquo;s footsteps had died out
down the hallway, &ldquo;maybe we should have taken
his offer. Twenty-five hundred dollars is a lot of
money, and we are quite poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, mother,&rdquo; spoke the lad. &ldquo;But I
think there is something back of all this, or why
should those men be making so many efforts to
get possession of this land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they want it for a special purpose,
Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they do, but they are not offering
what it is worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know your father used to say it was
worth very little,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did, mother, but the land may have
increased in value since he had it. It must have,
or those men would not come to us and make
an offer. If land is poor and of no worth you
have to go all around hunting for a customer,
but when it is of some value customers come to
you. That&rsquo;s what makes me think this land will
prove valuable. The men would not want it if
it was only ordinary swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter, with
a sigh, for it was hard to think of losing a chance
to get what, to her, was a large sum of money.
&ldquo;We may hold the property a good while, providing
it is not sold for taxes, and not get anywhere
near that price for it, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is a certain risk,&rdquo; admitted
Larry, &ldquo;but I think it is worth taking. Mr.
Newton thinks so, and has advised me to hold on
to the deed. We must put it away carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in that tin box where I have all your
father&rsquo;s old papers,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll keep the box under my bed,&rdquo;
spoke Larry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose a burglar would
take it if he saw it, but there&rsquo;s no use running
any chances. So I&rsquo;ll hide the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he went to bed that night he carried
the box with him, first looking to be sure the
deed was in it. Then he placed the receptacle
under his bed, away back, and close to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone wants to get that they&rsquo;ll have to
climb under the bed,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;And if they
do, I&rsquo;m pretty sure to wake up. Then&mdash;let&rsquo;s see,
I wonder what I would do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to look about him, in search of a
weapon, half smiling as he did so, since he had
not the faintest idea that a burglar would enter
their humble apartments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;That club will be just the thing,&rdquo; thought
Larry, as he saw a heavy stick standing in the
corner. It had been used as a clothes prop, for
the lines that were strung on the flat roof of the
tenement, and Jimmy, playing Indian, had
brought it into the house that day. &ldquo;This is
better than a revolver,&rdquo; thought Larry, placing
it at the head of his bed.</p>
<p>Then he fell asleep, to dream of nothing more
exciting than going fishing in the creek in his
old home at Campton. He dreamed he was pulling
a big fellow out, and that his pole broke,
tumbling him backward upon the grass. He
gave a great jump, which awakened him, and he
saw the sun shining brightly in through his
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! I must be late!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jumping
up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to hustle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a hurried breakfast, and arrived at
the office a few minutes after eight o&rsquo;clock, to
find the place somewhat excited. A number of
reporters were standing about, with copies of
morning papers, but they seemed to be more interested
in something else than in the journals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Larry, of some of the
younger reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big safe-robbery in Brown&rsquo;s jewelry store,&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard any particulars yet,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I just got the tip from police
headquarters. But they think a good many
thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of gold and diamond
jewelry is missing. The safe is a wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Just then Mr. Emberg came in, and Mr. Newton
quickly told the city editor of the robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump out on it,&rdquo; said Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;Take&mdash;let&rsquo;s
see&mdash;take Jones with you, and Larry also.
We want a good story. I&rsquo;ll send a photographer
down to take a picture of the safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry was well pleased to be assigned to help
two of the best reporters on the paper. Some of
the other men seemed a little envious of Larry,
but, as is usual in good newspaper offices, nothing
was said, and the men went out on their assignments,
as given by the city editor, without a murmur,
though some details were disagreeable
enough.</p>
<p>Larry, with the two other reporters, lost no
time in boarding a car for the scene of the robbery.
They found a big crowd outside the jewelry
store, which was located in a part of the city
where persons of society and wealth did much
of their shopping. A number of policemen, as
well as detectives in plain clothes, were on guard
in front of the establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, you&rsquo;ll have to move on,&rdquo; one of
the bluecoats cried. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t block the sidewalk.
Move on. There&rsquo;s nothing to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find a stray diamond or two,&rdquo;
suggested someone in the crowd, whereat there
was a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find any diamonds,&rdquo; rejoined the officer,
&ldquo;hand &rsquo;em over to me, and I&rsquo;ll get the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The three reporters made their way through
the crowd to the front door of the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t come in here at all, at all!&rdquo; exclaimed
a big Irish policeman, blockading their path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re reporters from the <i>Leader</i>,&rdquo; said Mr.
Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it if ye are editors from the <i>Tail-Ender</i>!&rdquo;
the bluecoat went on, with a smile at
his own wit. &ldquo;Orders are I&rsquo;m t&rsquo; let not a sowl
in at all, at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Pat,&rdquo; said a sergeant of police,
coming up at that juncture, and seeing how
matters were. &ldquo;These are not ordinary persons,
you know,&rdquo; with a smile at Mr. Newton and the
others. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if ye says it&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
the policeman said to his superior. &ldquo;Ye kin go
in,&rdquo; he added grandly to the newspaper men, as
he stepped aside.</p>
<p>It took but a glance to show what had happened.
Burglars had blown the massive door of
the safe open, by using some powerful explosive.
Then with tools they had pried open the
inner doors, and had taken whatever suited their
fancy. Larry wondered that the explosion had
not wrecked the store, in the center of which the
safe stood. He spoke of this to Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows used just enough explosive to
crack the door, but not enough to do any damage
outside,&rdquo; said the older reporter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Mr. Newton, who was in general charge of
getting the story, soon made his plans. A few
questions he put to one of the members of the
firm who was on hand, showed him how the affair
had occurred. The burglars had entered by
forcing a rear window. They had placed a screen
up in front of the safe, so that when the policeman
on the beat looked in through the front door,
as he frequently did during his rounds, he could
not see the thieves at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a night watchman?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Newton of the firm member, Robert Jamison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s the queer part of it. He
claims he was chloroformed by the thieves early
in the evening, or at least by one of them. We
sent him home, as he is quite ill from the effects
of the drug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good part of the story,&rdquo; said Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;Jones, you go down to the watchman&rsquo;s
house, and get all the particulars you can.
Larry will stay here, and help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jones had gone Mr. Newton made a
close survey of the premises. He made a rough
sort of diagram of how the thieves must have
entered, and how they probably escaped. Then
he told Larry to get a list of the diamonds and
jewelry that had been stolen. Mr. Newton in
the meantime had several talks with the police
officers about the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>By this time quite a number of reporters from
other papers had arrived, and, with the bluecoats
and detectives, the store was pretty well filled.
Mr. Jamison, with the assistance of one of his
partners, made up a list of the stolen things, and
then had his typewriter make several copies,
which were distributed among the reporters,
Larry getting one.</p>
<p>Larry could not help but think this was a
rather up-to-date method of reporting, where the
man who was robbed went to so much trouble
for the reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s glad to do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;You
see, the thieves will try to pawn their booty, and
by publishing a list of it, pawnbrokers will be on
the lookout. It&rsquo;s as much to his interest as it is
to ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After getting all the facts possible, Mr. Newton
and Larry waited until Jones came back from
the watchman&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton, when
Jones returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I got a good story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep quiet about it. Maybe none of the
others will think of sending down, and we&rsquo;ll beat
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared from the story the watchman told
Jones, that, early in the evening, a well-dressed
man had approached the guardian, whose name
was Henderson, and started a conversation with
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>They talked for some time, and finally the
stranger gave Henderson a cigar. The watchman
said he preferred a pipe, and asked the
stranger to wait until it could be brought from a
rear room where the watchman kept it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henderson went back to get it,&rdquo; said Jones,
in telling the story, &ldquo;and the stranger followed
him. The watchman was about to object, saying
no one was allowed in the place after dark. But
the stranger was so pleasant that the watchman
was not suspicious. He followed Henderson into
a sort of office in the rear, and there, while Henderson
was getting his pipe, the stranger suddenly
attacked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held a cloth with chloroform on, to his
nose, and, though the watchman struggled and
tried to cry out an alarm, the robber was too much
for him. Henderson was soon left unconscious,
and he thinks he must have been drugged, for
he did not recover his senses for several hours.
That&rsquo;s all he knows. When he came to, the safe
was blown open, and it was nearly morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That slick stranger, after drugging Henderson,
probably stayed in the store,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton,
&ldquo;and when the time came he admitted his
confederates. After that it was an easy job for
the professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ve got everything,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Newton, as he prepared to go. &ldquo;It will
make a good story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three <i>Leader</i> reporters had been standing
near the rear window whence the robbers gained
an entrance after their companion had, from
within, forced the bars outward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Larry, stooping over,
and picking up a small piece of paper. It had
some peculiar blue marks on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though someone had stuck their fingers
in a bottle of ink, and then placed them on
this paper,&rdquo; said Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>Larry handed it over. Mr. Newton took a
long look. Then he smelled the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled softly. &ldquo;This may give
us an important clew to the burglars!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WORKING UP THE CLEW</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Newton placed the paper in his pocket.
Then, as there seemed to be no further news of
the robbery to get at the jewelry store, the three
reporters hurried back to the <i>Leader</i> office.</p>
<p>There, after Larry and Jones had written out
their parts of the story, they turned them over
to Mr. Newton, who was to arrange the whole
article in proper shape. Larry, soon after this,
was sent out on another assignment, and did not
get a chance to see Mr. Newton until late that
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do to-night, Larry?&rdquo;
asked his friend, as they were about to leave for
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special, Mr. Newton. I don&rsquo;t do
any studying during the summer nights, though
I guess I need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, all work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy,&rdquo; responded Mr. Newton, with a smile.
&ldquo;Study is a good thing, but you need recreation
also. Do you want to make a call with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a chemist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say anything about it,&rdquo; went on
Mr. Newton, in a low tone, &ldquo;but we may be able
to work up a clew in that burglary story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that safe robbery we were up to
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one. I think the paper you found
may prove of value. But I want to be sure of
my ground before I go any further. So if you
will come to the chemist&rsquo;s with me to-night we&rsquo;ll
see what may develop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry didn&rsquo;t see how a scrap of paper with a
few blue finger-marks on it was going to be much
of a clew to discover safe-blowers by, but he said
nothing.</p>
<p>It was arranged that he was to call at Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s house after supper. He found the older
reporter waiting for him, and they took a car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I needn&rsquo;t tell you to keep quiet
about this,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said
anything, even to Mr. Emberg, about it, for fear
I might be mistaken, and get laughed at for my
pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not say anything,&rdquo; promised Larry.</p>
<p>In a short while they found themselves at the
office of the chemist. The place was shut up, but
Mr. Newton seemed to know where the scientist
lived, for he rang a bell a few houses off, and,
when a girl answered the door, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Hosfer in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, but he&rsquo;s very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell him Mr. Newton wants to see him,&rdquo;
said Larry, and the girl, with an air as much as
to say that her errand would be fruitless, hurried
off, leaving the two reporters standing on
the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very polite,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, as they
waited.</p>
<p>The girl was soon back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hosfer will see you,&rdquo; she said, with a
very different air. &ldquo;You must excuse me, but
you see there are so many thieves about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you we&rsquo;re not thieves,&rdquo; said Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;The umbrellas and hats in the hall
were perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed, and Mr. Newton joined in.
In the midst of the merriment Mr. Hosfer, who
was an old gentleman wearing iron-bowed spectacles
that seemed lost under his shaggy eyebrows,
shuffled into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is my old friend of the newspaper,&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;What terrible scandal have you
been writing up now? What horrible murder,
what soul-racking suicide, what terrible mystery,
what awful, terrible, horrible, monstrous, impossible
tale have you been concocting, my dear
friend?&rdquo; And he laughed as though it was
the most delightful thing in the world to have
sensations of the most pronounced kind served
up for breakfast, dinner, and supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Mr. Hosfer,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;We have nothing only the most ordinary
news to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! Nonsense! I know better,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;I know you would not be satisfied
with that. You will take a story of a little child
getting lost, and make a fearful, blood-curdling
mystery of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For it was Mr. Hosfer&rsquo;s opinion that all reporters
were of the sensational class, who loved
to dress simple facts up in word-garments of red
and green ink. He could not seem to get over
the notion, and perhaps it was because he seldom
read a paper, being too busy with his many experiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked the
chemist, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Have you a sample
of blood for me to analyze, or a dead body
you want me to boil up in a test-tube? Trot it
out,&rdquo; and he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you will be able to help
us or not,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, who had known
the chemist for a long time, and who had frequently
come to him for information concerning
stories where chemistry played a part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee to solve
impossibilities. I can&rsquo;t tell what you had for
breakfast by looking at your hat, as some reporters
think a detective can. Besides, I&rsquo;m not a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strictly in your line,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton,
pulling the piece of paper with blue marks
on it from his pocket, and holding it out to the
chemist. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The chemist looked at it without touching it.
He bent over closer, and applied his nose to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not bite you,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it will not,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But
I want to get every impression I can from it before
I take it into my hands. After I have handled
it I cannot detect the odor as plainly, providing
there is an odor, as there happens to be in this
case. Now, what do you want me to do?&rdquo; and
he took the blue-marked paper from Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made those marks?&rdquo; asked the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hosfer.
&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m a regular Sherlock Holmes. I
can&rsquo;t tell what made &rsquo;em at a moment&rsquo;s glance.
I doubt if even Sherlock Holmes could. I might
make a guess, and hit it, or I might not. Probably
not. I could say they were ink, or from a
typewriter ribbon, or from bluing that was used
at the weekly wash, or from water colors, or
from oil colors, or&mdash;or some chemical. I&rsquo;m inclined
to think they&rsquo;re some chemical, but, of
course, it&rsquo;s only a guess. You see, I only have
one chance among a good many certainties of
guessing. I must make an analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what we want you to do,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Can you do it now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I s&rsquo;pose I can,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I can
neglect all my other work to do something that
will turn out to be a terrible murder, a mysterious
shooting, a horrible suicide, a forgery, a
child-stealing, an attempt at arson, or something
worse. I can do it, I s&rsquo;pose, to please you,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, with a
laugh. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re as anxious to know what
made those blue spots as I am. You&rsquo;re going to
find out, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Hosfer, suddenly. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t do it for anyone else, but you&rsquo;ve done
me a number of favors, Mr. Newton, and I&rsquo;d
like to oblige you. Come into the laboratory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followed by Larry, Mr. Newton accompanied
Mr. Hosfer. The laboratory was in the rear
of the house. It was a place well filled with all
sorts of queer apparatus. There were rows of
bottles containing oddly-colored liquids and solids,
big flasks, small furnaces, pipes, odd machines,
scales, an electrical apparatus, test tubes,
alembics, retorts, crucibles, and all that goes to
make up a chemist&rsquo;s workshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now after I start to work,&rdquo; said Mr. Hosfer,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want either of you to ask me a question.
It bothers me, and I can&rsquo;t think. When I get
through you may talk all you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without more ado he started in. He tore off a
small piece of the paper, and put it to soak in a
tube which contained some liquid. Another
piece he placed in another tube. One piece he
burned, and saved the ashes from it on a tiny
dish. Still another piece he covered with some
white substance. All the while he kept muttering
to himself, like some old philosopher in search of
the secret of transmuting base metals into gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>After a little while he took up the tube in
which he had placed the piece of blue paper. He
poured into it a few drops of some liquid, and the
stuff in the tube changed color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought so,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Hosfer.</p>
<p>He rapidly made a number of other experiments,
going through similar performances. He
tested the ashes of the paper he had burned, and
even applied a small portion of them to his
tongue, making a wry face as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming on,&rdquo; he murmured, nodding
his head at Mr. Newton and Larry. &ldquo;We shall
be there presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mindful of the injunction neither of the reporters
spoke. They watched Mr. Hosfer with
interest.</p>
<p>Finally the experiments were over. The chemist
holding a test tube, in which was some violet-colored
liquid, came toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to hear what I have to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; spoke Mr. Newton, in half tragic
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever else that paper may have had on it,
and I have not gone far enough to say all the
things that were on it, that paper contained nitric
acid in some form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hosfer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Larry felt greatly disappointed. He had expected
something that would point a clew to the
burglars, and to learn that the paper had only
been marked by an acid, was somewhat of a
shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could nitric acid, such as is used in the explosive
nitro-glycerine, produce that color?&rdquo; was
Mr. Newton&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it could,&rdquo; said Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;I
knew you were coming to some terrible explosion,
some awful blowing up of innocent persons,
some catastrophe, some horrible cataclysm, some
terrific disturbance of the laws of nature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;But tell me this: If nitric acid made those
marks, and nitro-glycerine could do it, would a
person handling the explosive be likely to mark a
paper in that fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly so,&rdquo; said Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;I can
refer you to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;That is all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; asked the
chemist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to look for the man who made
those marks on the paper,&rdquo; replied the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you find him?&rdquo; asked Larry, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By looking for a man with a blue hand,&rdquo; was
Mr. Newton&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SEARCH FOR THE BLUE HAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hosfer,
as he watched Mr. Newton place what was left
of the blue paper in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I have a clew to the persons who
blew open the safe,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;As soon
as I saw that paper which Larry found, with the
blue marks on it, I thought it might have been
used by the burglars. I was at a loss to know
what could have caused the marks, but you, Mr.
Hosfer, have solved that problem for me. I
think I can manage the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t the blue marks wash off?&rdquo; asked
Larry. &ldquo;What good is the clew then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! The blue marks will not come off!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Will they, Mr. Hosfer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for some time,&rdquo; replied the chemist. &ldquo;I
see now what Mr. Newton is driving at. He is
going to solve a horrible, a dastardly, soul-curdling,
bloody mystery. The blue marks will
not come off. It is a peculiar feature of certain
forms of nitric acid, and also of nitro-glycerine,
which is made from the acid, that they will stain
the skin a bluish color. This color will not come
off until the skin wears off, and, as that takes
some time, you may be sure that your blue-handed
man will have to go around for a number
of weeks with the marks on his fingers and
thumb. I see what Mr. Newton is up to now.
Oh, but you&rsquo;re a sly dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly a matter of luck,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
&ldquo;You have been of great service to us,
Mr. Hosfer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think I should be mixed up in a terrible,
fearful, awful, shocking, sensational affair like
this,&rdquo; spoke the chemist, with a smile, as though
it was the best fun in the world. &ldquo;That comes
of having a reporter for a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, &ldquo;you ought to be
glad of a chance to aid the ends of justice by discovering
the safe-robber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I ask is to be let alone with my experiments,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;At the same time, if
Justice thinks I&rsquo;m entitled to anything, I might
say I have my living to earn, and it&rsquo;s none too
easy a task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Justice about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton,
with a laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton and Larry now took their leave.
They had found out what they wanted to know,
or at least Mr. Newton had, for Larry had no
suspicion of the object of the visit to the chemist&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo; asked the
lad of Mr. Newton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to begin a search for the blue-handed
man,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I want you to
help me. This will be aside from our regular
work on the <i>Leader</i>, though if we are successful,
it will mean that we&rsquo;ll get a good story for
the paper. We may have to work nights, and at
other times when we&rsquo;re not busy in the office or
on assignments. Do you want to go in for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reward offered, as far as I know,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Newton. &ldquo;The firm is insured in
a burglary concern, I understand, so they are not
worrying about the loss. But it would be a fine
thing if you and I could trace the thieves by
reason of this piece of blue-marked paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly would,&rdquo; rejoined Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Newton had a talk with Mr.
Emberg on the matter. He explained about the
blue-marked paper, and told how Larry had
found it, and how it might form a clew to the
identity of the burglars.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton told how he and Larry had
formed a plan of hunting for the blue-handed
man, and secured permission to leave the office
early afternoons, with Larry, on the trail of the
safe-blowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>For several days, however, there was so much
to do around the office or out on assignments,
that neither Larry nor Mr. Newton had a chance
to work on their quest. They did not forget it,
however. One afternoon Larry found a note on
his desk asking him to call at Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
house that night, as the older reporter had to go
out on a late story.</p>
<p>When Larry reached his friend&rsquo;s house, he
found that Mr. Newton had just come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost beat me, Larry,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton,
pleasantly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be ready for you in a
few minutes, as soon as I have a bite to eat. I&rsquo;m
rather hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it about the blue-handed man?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;That
is, not exactly him, but we&rsquo;re going to get on
his trail, and, perhaps, we can land some of his
confederates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Mr. Newton explained his plan.
It was that he and Larry would take every chance
they had of going about in the slums of New
York, for there it was that they might most naturally
expect to find the man they sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of the gang of safe-blowers
has left New York,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I
have talked with the detectives about the matter,
and they are sure that the criminals are hiding
here. The trouble is, New York is such a big
place it makes an excellent place to hide. The
detectives have been over every clew, but they
have succeeded very poorly so far. There&rsquo;s not
a trace of the men or the missing valuables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke if we got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said
Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost too good a joke to be true,&rdquo; was Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>The two reporters laid their plans, and put
them into operation the next day. All the time
they could spare from their office work they used
in tramping about the worst parts of New York.
Mr. Newton &ldquo;knew the ropes&rdquo; from having been
on frequent assignments to localities where happenings
grave and gay had occurred.</p>
<p>Together they went through the Bowery, into
Chinatown, with its Joss houses, heavy with the
smell of incense sticks, into Chinese dwellings
where the reek of opium lingered, and into dives
of all sorts.</p>
<p>All the while they sought but one man, a man
who had blue hands, or blue marks on his fingers
and thumbs. They were not interested in faces
or clothes. All they looked at was hands.</p>
<p>For two weeks they kept up this tiresome work.
They had any number of strange experiences.
Once they came near to being caught in a raid
the police made on a certain place, where, it was
said, Chinese gambling was carried on. Again
they were in places where fierce fights started,
and where the first thing that happened was that
the lights went out. But each time they came
through all right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>All this while, however, their quest seemed to
be fruitless. They could not find the man they
sought. They made guarded inquiries, for they
did not want it known what their object was, in
frequenting the slums. But they did not meet
with any success.</p>
<p>Once, indeed, they thought they were on the
right track. A woman, of whom they inquired
if she had ever seen a man with blue marks on his
hands, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure. He lif by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives with you!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, thinking,
perhaps, he had stumbled upon the wife of
the man they sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I means in de same houses,&rdquo; explained the
woman, who was German. &ldquo;His hands is as blue
like de skies. He iss de man vat you vant. His
hands is blue as vat nefer vas. He vorks in a
place where dey makes bluing for clothes. Ah!
sure his hands iss blue, but he iss a goot man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s not the man we are after,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;The hands of the man we
want are not blue all over, only part blue; a little
blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, den, I knows,&rdquo; said the woman, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss his liddles boy vat you vants. His
hands is littler as his fader&rsquo;s, and dey iss not blue
all over; only part blue. Ah, yes, I knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the woman for her information,
which, however, was of no value, Mr. Newton
and Larry gave up their quest in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to start on a fresh trail in the
morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, when he and Larry
were eating a modest lunch in a cheap restaurant
about twelve o&rsquo;clock that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if we were going to succeed,&rdquo;
spoke Larry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been at it a good
while, and haven&rsquo;t accomplished anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up so easily,&rdquo; counseled Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the trail of stories for several
months before I landed &rsquo;em. This business isn&rsquo;t
done in a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The restaurant was almost deserted. At a
table in the rear three men sat eating. Larry and
Mr. Newton had paid no attention to them. As
the men got up to go out they went close by the
table where the two reporters sat. As they went
by one of them said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Noddy will be helping us again
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this one of the other men made this rather
strange reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until he can take his gloves off. You
know, he&rsquo;s all blue from that last affair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned the third man, with a
glance at the table where the two reporters were
sitting, but who could not be seen very clearly,
as their chairs were in a shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what he said?&rdquo; asked Larry,
when the men had gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton, with some show
of eagerness. &ldquo;It may have referred to our man,
and again, and more likely, it may not. I wonder
who those men were?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know who one was,&rdquo; said Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; spoke the lad, &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;s the same man who called on my mother that
second time to ask her to sell him the Bronx property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton, half rising
from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think we are on the trail,&rdquo; said Mr.
Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that man is a sort of lawyer who
stands in with criminals of all kinds. He defends
them when it is necessary, and helps them
out of trouble. Of course, it may be only a coincidence,
but I&rsquo;m almost certain now, that he
knows something of the blue-handed man we are
seeking. Now we begin to see a little ray of
light. We have been working in the dark up to
now. I know where to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do any more to-night?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. You&rsquo;d better go home and go
to bed. In the morning I&rsquo;ll commence in another
direction. I have a friend, a detective, who will
help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Larry started home. He would have gone
much faster than he did, had he known what
strange news awaited him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LARRY MEETS HIS OLD ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>When Larry was walking along a street that
led to the thoroughfare on which he lived, he was
suddenly brought to a halt in front of a brilliantly-lighted
cigar store, by hearing someone
exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if there isn&rsquo;t my old friend, Larry Dexter!
How are you, Larry? Still on the <i>Leader</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry turned, to behold Peter Manton, a former
copy boy on the newspaper, a lad with whom
Larry had had numerous fallings out, and once
quite a fight. He had not seen Peter often since
the memorable race to get first to the telegraph
office with news of the big flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; asked Larry, not very cordially,
for he felt that Peter was an enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
hurry? Wait, and I&rsquo;ll buy you a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke cigarettes,&rdquo; rejoined Larry, not
caring to announce that, as yet, he did not smoke
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get mad,&rdquo; said Peter, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I suppose you have a grudge against
me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Larry, frankly, &ldquo;I think you
acted pretty mean when you smashed my boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I did,&rdquo; admitted Peter. &ldquo;But you
must remember I was very anxious to get my
copy on the wire first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I,&rdquo; added Larry, &ldquo;and I beat you,&rdquo;
and he could not help smiling at the recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you got me fired by it,&rdquo; spoke Peter,
with an injured air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked Larry, for though he
had seen Peter since the episode, he had not had
a chance to talk to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the people on the <i>Scorcher</i> found out
I was responsible for your paper beating them
they told me to look for another position. I
didn&rsquo;t have much trouble finding one, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo; asked Larry, thinking
it would be no more than common politeness to
ask. He was anxious to get home, however, and
not very much interested in Peter or his projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m with the Universal Real Estate Company,&rdquo;
said Peter. &ldquo;I have a swell job. Mr.
Perkins is a great friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry started. He recollected that it was the
same company and the same man who had approached
him, and who had seemed so anxious
about the deed to the Bronx property. He decided
he would not be in such a hurry to go home,
but would make further inquiries from Peter.
It might lead to something, he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t give up the newspaper
business,&rdquo; went on Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard work and
poor pay. Maybe I could get you into our firm,&rdquo;
and he spoke as though he was the senior partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Larry, as if he
was thinking of the matter. &ldquo;I have very little
knowledge of real estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to have,&rdquo; spoke Peter. &ldquo;You
could get along all right. All you have to do is
to go around and see people, get descriptions of
property, and keep a few books. It&rsquo;s heaps easier
than chasing copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not chasing copy any more,&rdquo; replied
Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a regular reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; went on Peter. &ldquo;You never
know when you&rsquo;re through working. Now I
finish by three o&rsquo;clock every day, and have the
rest of the time to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your firm do much business?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet. And say, it&rsquo;s going to do more. If
you came in with us now I could put you on to
a good thing. There&rsquo;s going to be a big raise
in land values in a certain locality in a little while,
and our firm&rsquo;s going to make a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the land?&rdquo; asked Larry, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; sneered Peter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling everyone. But, if you like, I&rsquo;ll
speak to Mr. Perkins for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;You might,&rdquo; said Larry, thinking it would be
no harm to get as much information as possible.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time the two youths had been
standing in front of the cigar store. Larry was
thinking it was about time for him to move on,
as he did not want to arouse Peter&rsquo;s suspicions
by too many questions, when a short, stout, and
dark-complexioned man came hurrying around
the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d gone,&rdquo; the man said to
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was talking with a friend of mine,&rdquo;
replied the former copy boy on the <i>Leader</i>. &ldquo;Are
you through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;But I had no success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry looked idly at the stranger. He noticed
he wore gloves, and this, at first glance, struck
him as peculiar, for the night was warm. Still
this fact was not so surprising, and Larry&rsquo;s mind
was about to pass over the incident when his eye
happened to catch a glimpse of something blue
about the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>At first he thought it was the edge of a blue
cuff. He looked again, more closely, and was
startled to see that part of the glove was turned
back at the wrist, and that the flesh which showed
was deep blue in color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Larry was so startled by the sight, so alarmed
at the unexpected appearance of the blue mark,
bringing as it did to his mind a recollection of
the safe robbery, that he was afraid the man
might notice his surprise. But Peter&rsquo;s acquaintance
did not pay any attention to Larry. He
seemed in a hurry, and anxious to be moving
on.</p>
<p>Larry began to wish that there might be some
excuse for remaining longer in the company of
Peter and the man. Yet he was afraid that if he
did so, the stranger might suspect something, and
hurry away before Larry had a chance to communicate
with Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>In order to be sure of the person when he saw
him again Larry looked closely at him. He saw
that he had piercing black eyes, a nervous manner,
a small, black mustache which he pulled at from
time to time, and there was a small scar under his
left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know him if I ever see him again,&rdquo;
thought Larry.</p>
<p>The man seemed ill at ease. Suddenly he discovered
that the edge of his glove was turned
back. With a quick motion he buttoned the
article up.</p>
<p>As he did so he glanced sharply at Larry, as
if anxious to know whether the lad had noticed
anything. Larry pretended that his shoelace
needed tying, and stooped over to avoid meeting
the fellow&rsquo;s look. As Larry straightened up he
heard the stranger call out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Peter. There&rsquo;s our car,&rdquo; and, before
Larry could have stopped them, had he desired
to, or thought it wise, they were running
after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s finding a man and losing him in
a hurry,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;I wonder what I&rsquo;d
better do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first he thought of calling on Mr. Newton.
But as the reporter lived quite a distance away
Larry decided this would not be wise. Then he
thought he would call his friend up on the telephone.
But the idea of talking about the blue-handed
man over the wire, where anyone might
hear it, did not seem to be exactly right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait until morning,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t do anything now. Besides we&rsquo;re on the
right trail. I know where to find Peter, and
maybe I can get some information out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this end in view Larry proceeded on his
way home. It was getting close to midnight,
and he was a little worried lest his mother be
alarmed over his long absence. He found her
waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Larry!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You have given
me such a fright!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought perhaps those men had done
you some harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the ones who are trying to get the deed
away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they been bothering you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. One was here a while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it anyone that had been here before?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this was a different one. He came in
about nine o&rsquo;clock when the children were in bed,
and Lucy and I sitting here. He seemed nice at
first, and then he began to ask me about the deed.
He said you had sent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, mother? I never sent anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what he said. He wanted me to
sign an agreement to sell the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t sign, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, Larry, and when I refused the
man was very angry. He tried to hide his feelings,
but I could see he was mad. Then he
wanted to look at the deed, but I remembered
what you had said, and I would not show it to
him. Pretty soon he went away, but I was very
much frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a looking man was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather short, and dark-complexioned. He
had a little black mustache which he kept pulling
at all the time, and there was a scar under his
left eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry started as he heard these details. He
began to see who the man was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice anything else about him,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special, except that he kept his gloves
on all the while he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Larry. I spoke of it to Lucy afterward.
I even asked him to take them off, as
it was rather warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed quite excited, and buttoned up one
that had come open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, but Lucy did. She spoke to
me about it afterward. She said she caught a
glimpse of the man&rsquo;s wrist where the glove was
turned back, and it seemed to be of a red color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red color!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean blue,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Dexter. &ldquo;She
said it looked as if the man worked in a bluing
factory. Perhaps that is why he kept his gloves
on. He did not want people to see his blue
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo; said Larry, trying
to speak calmly. But he was greatly excited.
The plot, which seemed to involve him and his
folks in the safe-robbing, seemed to be growing
more tangled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN WHICH THE DEED IS MISSING</span></h2>
<p>Larry decided it would be better not to tell
his mother anything concerning the blue-handed
man, or his connection with the safe-robbery.
He felt it would only make her worry, and would
be of no particular good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll solve this thing myself,&rdquo; thought the
young reporter. &ldquo;I guess Mr. Newton and I can
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after a few more questions, and added injunctions
to his mother never to let the deed go
out of her possession, Larry went to bed.</p>
<p>His mother soon sought her room, and presently
the household was quiet. It was now past
midnight, and everyone in the tenement seemed
to be asleep.</p>
<p>It was rather a quiet neighborhood, and persons
living in it were not in the habit of staying
up late. The policemen whose beats took in those
streets seldom paid a visit to them, for they knew
there would not, in all likelihood, be any disturbances.</p>
<p>It grew a little cooler as the night wore on, and
people who had been kept awake by the previous
hot spell were making up for their lost sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>If any persons in the tenement, or apartment,
where Larry and his mother lived, had been
awake about three o&rsquo;clock that morning they
might have wondered at the sight of two figures
stealthily creeping up through the side alleyway
that led to the rear cellar door, and the stairs
leading to the back doors of the various rooms.
Two dark figures there were, moving along, almost
as silently as shadows.</p>
<p>Now and then they would stop and whisper
together, but, so quiet were their voices and so
silent their steps that not a person heard
them.</p>
<p>The policeman on the beat came to the head
of the street, and looked down it. He saw nothing.
How could he see the two figures in the
alley? The officer remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all quiet there. What&rsquo;s the use of
walking down? I&rsquo;ll just go over to the avenue,
and have a chat with Hennessy, and smoke a
cigar before the roundsman comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the policeman passed away. Meanwhile
the two dark figures crept on. In a little while
they had reached the cellar door. Cautiously one
of the men drew from his pocket a small instrument
like a cold chisel or a screwdriver, except
that it had no wooden handle. One edge was
broad and sharp, like a wedge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The man went close to the cellar door. He put
the edge of the instrument between the door and
the jamb, close to the lock. There was a little
crackling sound, hardly enough to waken the
lightest sleeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo; whispered the man who had
remained on guard outside the cellar door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the whisper in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go ahead and start the blaze. Don&rsquo;t
make much of a one. Put it near the dumbwaiter
shaft, so the smoke will go up quickly. Use wet
paper. It makes more smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; came back, in whispered accents.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my part, if you do yours. Do you know
where they keep the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Under the bed,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;The old lady gave it away when I was talking
to her to-night, only she never knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, while one of the men made his way into
the cellar, the other began creeping up the rear
stairs of the apartment house. And, if one had
looked closely at the man who was creeping upstairs,
they would have seen that his hands were
encased in gloves, though it was summer time and
quite hot.</p>
<p>Up and up he went, step by step, trying each
one, to be sure it did not creak, before he trusted
his weight on it. Now and then he would stop,
and peer on all sides of him. Then he would
listen to catch the faintest sound. But there was
no noise. Not even the step of the policeman on
the beat disturbed him. From afar came the hum
of the big city, the roar of cars and elevated
trains, the throb of traffic in the metropolis that
never goes to sleep, but in the neighborhood of
the tenement house all was quietness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>All at once the man on the steps began to sniff
the air, like an animal scenting danger from afar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s started the fire! I can smell the kerosene
oil!&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;Now for the final
scene!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully he walked along until he came to the
door that led into the kitchen of the Dexter apartments.
From his pocket he drew forth a small
instrument similar to that which the other man
had used. He placed the sharp edge between
the door and the jamb, close to the lock. He
pried on it. There was a slight crack, and the
door had been opened with a burglar&rsquo;s jimmy.</p>
<p>An instant later there broke out on the night
air that most dreaded of all alarms in the midst
of the crowded population of New York&rsquo;s poor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the cry that smote on the ears of
those who were suddenly awakened from their
slumbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How it echoed down into the yard! How it
sounded into the sleeping rooms! How it penetrated
down the street, and even farther to where
the policeman was smoking a cigar before the
roundsman came!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Up through the tenement poured a volume of
thick smoke. Thick, stifling vapor that rolled
up through the dumbwaiter shaft, that penetrated
to the rooms, and set the frightened tenants to
coughing.</p>
<p>What a scramble there was then! What a hurrying
and scurrying to leap from bed, to grasp
whatever garments came nearest to hand, to wrap
them about one, and then, if there were children,
to grab them up, and run for the hall!</p>
<p>What a scene of terror succeeded what, but a
few minutes before, had been a peaceful one!
Frightened yells and screams mingled with the
alarm of fire shouted by a loud voice. Children
began to cry. Women laughed hysterically, and
men called to one another to know where the
blaze was, for no flames could be seen. Only
there was that black and stifling smoke.</p>
<p>The man who had so stealthily crept up the
stairs suddenly leaped into the kitchen of the
Dexter home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Hurry up out!
The house is on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dexter screamed. Mary and Jimmy began
to cry. Lucy slipped on a robe, and ran into
her mother&rsquo;s room. Larry leaped from his bed,
and, pausing only to pull on his trousers, ran to
where the others had gathered in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all out?&rdquo; shouted the man, in the
darkness. &ldquo;Come on. I&rsquo;ll carry the little boy.
You take the little girl, lad. The other girl can
help the old lady!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Then grabbing up Jimmy, the man, whose
hands were encased in gloves, half led, half
pushed the little group on before him. Larry,
dazed from sleep, grabbed up Mary, and, seeing
that Lucy was leading her mother safely down,
followed; the man bringing up the rear with
Jimmy, who was hardly awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the house on fire?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Can&rsquo;t you smell the smoke?&rdquo; asked
the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean is it bad?&rdquo; cried Larry. &ldquo;Because if
it isn&rsquo;t I must go back for some of our clothes
and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop for that now,&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all burned up! Save your lives first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all the excitement of it Larry could not help
wondering where he had heard that voice before.
But there was little time to think of this.</p>
<p>Down the stairs they ran, being joined by other
tenants from every floor, all of whom were fleeing
in scant attire. The cries of &ldquo;fire&rdquo; were being
called now by scores of voices.</p>
<p>In about a minute, though it seemed five times
as long as that, Larry, his mother, and all the
others had emerged on the street. They found
themselves in the midst of a motley throng, but
in the excitement no one seemed to mind the
strangeness of the attire.</p>
<p>One man was carrying two pillows, while his
wife had a bird cage. Another man was trying
to put his trousers on for a coat, and a third was
endeavoring to drag a brass bed down the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Then came a shrill tooting whistle followed by
the gallop of horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engines are coming!&rdquo; cried Larry. &ldquo;Get
back out of the way, mother. Here, Jimmy, you
and Mary stay close to me. We&rsquo;ll go into one
of these other houses. The fire doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be bad. Then I must go back after that box of
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the gloves, who had roused the
Dexter family, had placed Jimmy down on the
sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to rescue some more!&rdquo; he
cried, as he sped up the smoke-filled hallway.
He seemed anxious to save human lives even at
the risk of his own.</p>
<p>By this time half a score of engines and trucks
had drawn up in front of the tenement, summoned
by the alarm the policeman had turned
in.</p>
<p>The various apparatus had not come to a halt
before dozens of firemen had leaped to the
ground, and run into the house. They wasted no
time. While some sprang up the stairs to rescue
any persons who had been left behind, others
sought the source of the blaze. They soon discovered
it to be in the cellar.</p>
<p>Lighting the way with lanterns they carried
they dashed down, not minding the choking
smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Run in a chemical line!&rdquo; shouted a battalion
chief through a small megaphone he carried.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a pile of rubbish on fire. We don&rsquo;t
need any water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly a small hose from the chemical engine
was unreeled. The engineer turned a crank
at one end of a big cylinder, and a bottle inside
which contained vitriol was smashed, allowing
the contents to mingle with a strong solution
of soda water. This created carbonic-acid gas,
and forced the mingled liquids out through the
hose at high pressure.</p>
<p>On to the blazing pile of rubbish the chemicals
were turned, and the little blaze, which was more
of smoke than of fire, was soon out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; cried the battalion chief, five
minutes later. &ldquo;You can go back to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people began to laugh hysterically, so sudden
was the relief from anxiety. Several could
not believe but what the house was doomed. The
firemen, however, assured them there was no
danger. Through the open windows the smoke
was soon blown away. The engines started back
to quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, mother,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;I guess we
can go back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! Wasn&rsquo;t that just like a circus!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jimmy.</p>
<p>Up the stairs the Dexters went. On the way
they were joined by scores of other tenants, all
talking at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if my papers and that deed are
safe,&rdquo; thought Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>As soon as he got back to his bedroom he
looked for the box. He crawled under the bed,
and felt about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a hurried search of the room. The
box had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been robbed during the fire!&rdquo; exclaimed
Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A STRANGE OFFER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Dexter. &ldquo;I hope no one
has taken my gold breastpin and my ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they didn&rsquo;t take my book of fairy stories!&rdquo;
came from Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean thieves have been in here during
the fire?&rdquo; asked Lucy, as she sat down on a
chair in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;The
box of papers, in which the deed to the Bronx
land was kept, is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you took it out with you, in your excitement,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I know we have been
robbed. The more I think of it the more I believe
the fire was only a make-believe one, started
to scare us so we would get out and give the thief
a chance to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dexter could hardly credit this, but Larry
insisted he was right. The firemen went through
the building to make sure there were no lurking
sparks, and some of them said the blaze had
amounted to nothing more than a small bit of
rubbish on fire in the cellar, which confirmed
Larry&rsquo;s belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>He said nothing more to his mother, however,
as she was much excited over the fire. Soon
they returned to bed, though Mary and Jimmy
were the only ones who slept much afterward,
as the others were too nervous.</p>
<p>Larry was much puzzled. That bold and daring
men were plotting against the welfare of himself
and his relatives he had little doubt. He
was convinced that the blaze was only started for
the purpose of giving someone an opportunity of
getting possession of the deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they go to such lengths to get it, there must
be something very valuable about it,&rdquo; thought
Larry.</p>
<p>Long and earnestly he thought over the matter.
He recalled the man who had rushed into their
apartments to notify them of the fire, and his suspicions
grew that he had heard his voice somewhere
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he could be someone whom I have
been to see to get a story for the paper,&rdquo; thought
Larry.</p>
<p>He reviewed as well as he could the men he
had called on since he had been a reporter. None
of them seemed to fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; the lad exclaimed to himself, as he
tossed on his bed in the darkness; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the man
who came up while I was talking to Peter. He&rsquo;s
the man who kept his gloves on when he came
to see mother. He&rsquo;s the blue-handed man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Once he had established this fact to his satisfaction,
Larry&rsquo;s mind worked quickly. That
there was some connection between the blue-handed
man&rsquo;s operations, the safe-robbery, and
the theft of the deed, Larry had no doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are getting into a strange mix-up,&rdquo;
thought the young reporter. &ldquo;As soon as I think
I am on the track of one part of the mystery it
gets all tangled up with another part. I would
like to catch that blue-handed man. Then, I believe,
I would have one of the safe-robbers, I
might get the deed back, and learn what is behind
this land matter. It might make us wealthy. I
wish it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, after much thinking over of the problems
without result, Larry dropped off into a
doze. When he awoke it was broad daylight,
and the only thing to remind him of the night&rsquo;s
excitement was a heavy odor of smoke in the
rooms. The whole house smelled as though
someone had been curing hams in it.</p>
<p>Larry made a hasty breakfast, for it was getting
late. Before he started for the office he
made a search of the rooms, hoping against hope
that he might come across the box of papers.
But it was nowhere to be seen. He crawled under
the bed, and lighted a match.</p>
<p>There in the dust, close to the wall, was the
mark where the box had stood. Close by was a
small, dark object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that is,&rdquo; thought Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>He reached for it. It was soft. Wonderingly
he carried it to the light and examined the article.
It was a man&rsquo;s glove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember losing any of mine,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>
<p>He looked at the glove more closely. It was
too large to have ever fitted his hand. He turned
it inside out. To his surprise the lining was
streaked with blue, and there was a peculiar odor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was worn by the blue-handed man!&rdquo;
whispered Larry, excitedly. &ldquo;He has been here!
There is no doubt now but that he took the box!
I will save this for evidence in case I ever catch
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry had a number of assignments that day,
taking him to various parts of the city. He had
to attend a brief session of a church society, then
he had to get an obituary of a well-known business
man, next he had to cover a session of a subcommittee
of the Board of Aldermen, and finally
he was sent to see a man who offered to jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge backward, provided some
other person would jump with him, for a wager.</p>
<p>So Larry was rather tired out when afternoon
came, and the <i>Leader</i> had gone to press for the
last edition. He wanted a chance to tell Mr.
Newton what had happened, and ask his advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what would you do?&rdquo; asked Larry,
when he had finally told the older reporter about
the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;That is, right away. If you go to the police,
which is the most natural thing to do, in case of
a robbery, these men&mdash;for I am sure now that
there is a gang of them&mdash;will know it very
shortly. In some mysterious way the thieves
learn what the police know almost as soon as the
authorities find things out themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do then?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just keep quiet,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The
thief, or thieves, are waiting to see what you will
do. If you can fool them, so much the better.
They must be desperate, or they would not venture
to take the deed. To make any use of it they
must forge signatures, and that is a risky proceeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to see what they are up to.
I heard a rumor the other day of a plan that will
enormously increase real estate values up in the
Bronx section. It may be that the gang is behind
this. Now while they have an advantage
over you in that they have the deed, there is a
certain element of risk in it for them. Deeds
are bad things to monkey with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think they&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I am
in the dark, just as much as you are. We can
only wait. It may be that they took the deed in
order to gain some hold over you, to force you to
do what they want, and sell them the property.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is any connection between
the man who was in to see my mother&mdash;the man
who took the deed&mdash;and the man who was in the
safe-blowing gang?&rdquo; asked Larry, anxious to
know how sound his own theories were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the same man is concerned in all three
transactions. The thing to do now is to catch
him. If we do we can have him arrested on suspicion
of the safe-robbery, and then we can work
up the land matter. But wait a few days before
you do anything, and if anything new turns up,
let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Newton was sent out of
town on an assignment. Larry, too, had his
hands full, for several reporters were on vacations,
and it meant doubling up all around. One
afternoon, chancing to look over the &ldquo;personal&rdquo;
advertisement column of the paper, he saw the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;BLUE.&mdash;If return of document is desired
from the fire, L. had better insert personal, making
arrangements to sell land. Otherwise will
suffer. Address, Mr. Hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather odd,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;It almost
seems as if it was meant for me, and as if
it was put in by the blue-handed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he looked at it the more certain he
was that some one of the gang had become
afraid to try and use the deed illegally, and had
taken this means of frightening him and his
mother into complying with the gang&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those words &lsquo;blue&rsquo; and &lsquo;hand&rsquo; are certainly
put in so that I will see them,&rdquo; thought Larry.
&ldquo;They must know we are on their track, yet they
are very daring to come out so openly about it.
I wonder what I had better do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he showed the advertisement to
Mr. Newton. The latter was interested at once.
He made inquiries at the business office of the paper
to learn who had brought the personal in.
There he met with a snag, for it had been sent in
by mail, with stamps inclosed sufficient to pay for
one insertion. This was frequently done with
small advertisements.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton had the letter hunted up which accompanied
the advertisement, but this gave no
clews, as it was typewritten, as was the advertisement
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to date, at any rate,&rdquo; the older
reporter said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Larry, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put an answering personal in,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll write it. We&rsquo;ll see if we
can&rsquo;t beat them at their own game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scribbled down a few words on a slip of
paper, glanced over it, changed it slightly, and
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;HAND.&mdash;L. will do as you wish. Say where
and when matter can be closed and deed returned.
<span class="jr">BLUE.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to fetch them,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll put it in the paper, and wait for results.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>They did not have a long delay. The day following
the insertion of the personal by Mr. Newton,
Larry received a letter. It was typewritten,
and came to his house. It was short, and directed
him, if he wished to get the deed back, to sign
a certain agreement which was inclosed in the
missive, and leave the agreement in a cigar store,
the address of which, Larry noted, was the same
as the one in front of which he had met Peter
Manton.</p>
<p>As for the agreement it was a short one, in
which Larry promised, in consideration of receiving
certain valuable property, to convey, by a
warranty deed, to certain persons to be named
hereafter, a tract of land in the Bronx.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the agreement in an envelope, and send it
back to them,&rdquo; advised Mr. Newton, when he
was told of the matter. &ldquo;I think we can catch
the scoundrels. Even if you filled out the paper
I doubt if it would stand in law, but we will not
take that chance. Just leave it blank, put it in an
envelope, and leave it in the cigar store. Ask
no questions, and leave the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SIGN OF THE BLUE HAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I do it?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; mused Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to lay my plans carefully. I guess to-morrow
night would be a good time. We&rsquo;ll write another
personal, and put it in the paper to-morrow, telling
the gang the document will be in the cigar
store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when they come to get it we&rsquo;ll have a
policeman on hand, and arrest whoever comes
for it,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would think that was the thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know these chaps, Larry. If we
arranged to have a detective on guard, ready to
grab whoever claimed the paper, the gang would
learn of it in some way, and they would never
come near the place. We will have to be foxier
than that. We&rsquo;ll have to do the watching ourselves,
or rather I will. I believe none of the
gang knows me. I&rsquo;ll arrange to be in the cigar
store to-morrow night, and I&rsquo;ll follow whoever
calls for the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>So it was arranged. The document, unsigned,
was placed in the envelope which the men behind
the land plot had sent to Larry. He took it to
the cigar store. The proprietor of the place kept
a sort of private post-office, and had a number of
boxes in which he kept mail or other things for
his customers who preferred doing business
that way rather than through the government
agency.</p>
<p>Larry handed the envelope to the man. The
young reporter wanted to ask who Mr. Hand
was, and where he lived, but he refrained, for
he thought the cigar man would probably refuse
to answer, or else say he did not know.</p>
<p>That evening Mr. Newton stopped in the store
to get a cigar. He thought the proprietor eyed
him rather sharply, but Mr. Newton was used
to meeting all sorts of persons in his capacity as
a reporter, and did not mind being stared at. He
tried to engage the proprietor in conversation,
but the cigar dealer was not in a very pleasant
mood, and answered shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised a friend I would meet him here
this evening,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;Have you any
objections to me waiting in your store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like people hanging around,&rdquo;
was the rather ungracious answer. &ldquo;This place
is small, and I need all the room there is to do
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend might want to buy a box of cigars,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, if he&rsquo;s coming here in the way
of trade,&rdquo; said the cigar man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objections
to your waiting, but as a general thing I
don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to be polite, but it was hard work.
He even got a chair for Mr. Newton to sit on,
but all the time the cigar man seemed nervous
and ill at ease. He kept watching the door, as
though he expected someone to come in who
would object to the reporter&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and there was no sign of the
blue-handed man or any messenger from him.
Several persons called, and got letters or packages
from the boxes, but the document which
Larry had placed in the envelope in accordance
with the instructions contained in the personal,
was not disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they are suspicious,&rdquo; thought
the reporter. &ldquo;They may have someone on the
watch, or the proprietor may have sent them
word that a stranger is in the store, and advising
them to be cautious. However, I&rsquo;ll wait a
while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hour passed, and it was getting on to
eleven o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Newton was about to give
up his vigil as fruitless, when a youth entered,
went quickly up to the box, and took out the envelope.
Mr. Newton screened his face with a
newspaper, but looked over the top of the sheet to
see who the messenger of the mysterious gang
was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Peter Manton, who used to be
a copy boy on the <i>Leader</i>!&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;Well, of all things! To think of him being
mixed up with that gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so surprised that he forgot to keep the
paper up in front of his face, and lowered the
sheet. After getting the letter from the box,
Peter glanced over in the corner where Mr. Newton
sat. He recognized the reporter at once, and
seemed much startled on beholding him.</p>
<p>Shoving the envelope containing the blank
agreement into his pocket, Peter hurried out of
the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get after him!&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.
He purchased a few cigars from the storekeeper
to make some compensation for his long use of
the chair, and, murmuring something about his
friend probably having been detained, hurried
from the place after Peter.</p>
<p>As soon as he got outside he looked up and
down the street to see in what direction the former
copy boy had gone. At first he could catch
no glimpse of him. There were only a few persons
on the thoroughfare, however, and soon Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s trained eyes picked out the youth hurrying
along on the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to get away,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton,
as he stepped out briskly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll trail
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>If Mr. Newton could have seen the figure of a
short, stout man glide out from the shadow of
the cigar store, as he himself left the place, and follow
after him, he might not have felt so easy in his
mind about his ability to catch Peter. The man,
taking after Mr. Newton, moved rapidly along,
taking care to keep well in the shadows. His
hat was pulled down low over his face, and on
his hands were a pair of new gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying a smart trick,&rdquo; the man muttered,
as he shadowed Mr. Newton, &ldquo;but I guess
we&rsquo;re on to your game. It&rsquo;s a good thing I sent
the boy instead of going myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the double chase continued. Peter
hurried on, obeying the instructions he had received.
He crossed several streets, and made his
way to that part of New York known as Chinatown,
in the neighborhood of Pell and Mott
streets, the place of the slums and opium joints.</p>
<p>After him came Mr. Newton, who kept as
close behind the lad as was possible without detection.
After Mr. Newton came the man wearing
a new pair of gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing Larry didn&rsquo;t undertake this
thing alone,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton. &ldquo;The chase
is leading into a dangerous part of town. But
it&rsquo;s just the place where I&rsquo;d expect the gang to
have its headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t give up until he gets where
I want him to,&rdquo; murmured the man with the
gloves. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll show him a thing or
two, and I guess he&rsquo;ll not be so fond of monkeying
with other people&rsquo;s affairs after this,&rdquo; and
he smiled in a cruel sort of way that boded no
good to Mr. Newton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Peter was playing his part well. He must have
known he was being followed, yet he gave no
sign. If Mr. Newton had not been so intent on
the chase, he might have noticed that the former
copy boy was not going as fast as would have a
messenger on a somewhat dangerous mission.
Peter was only leading the reporter on.</p>
<p>The boy swung into the Bowery, which at this
hour of midnight was ablaze with lights, and
crowded with people. Mr. Newton had some
trouble keeping the youth in sight, but by shortening
the distance between himself and Peter,
he managed to get glimpses of him now and
again. Finally Peter turned into Pell Street. He
walked on past several houses, and came to a
halt in front of a Chinese store. In the windows
were all sorts of queer things that the Celestials
use for food.</p>
<p>There were vegetables like cucumbers, pickled
watermelon rind, sweetened ginger root, Lichi
nuts, sunflower seeds, pickled eggs, dried sharks&rsquo;
fins, the pith of bamboo shoots, ready for eating,
bottles of rice wine, odd-shaped dishes, and many
chopsticks. It was a Chinese grocery.</p>
<p>At the left of the main entrance was a smaller
one leading up a flight of stairs. In the hallway
a lamp, shaded by red paper on which were some
Chinese characters, gave a faint illumination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>With a careful look about him, as if to see
whether he was followed, Peter entered the hallway,
and began to mount the stairs. Mr. Newton
hesitated. He might be running into a trap
if he went in. Though he knew he was in
New York, and that there were police officers
close at hand, he realized that often many crimes
were committed in Chinatown that never reached
the police.</p>
<p>But he wanted very much to find out what sort
of a gang was behind the mysterious operations
that had involved the Dexter family, and which
gang also seemed to be mixed up in the safe-robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>He paused a few seconds, as if to look at the
things in the grocery window. Instead of observing
them, however, he was carefully looking
around to see if there were any suspicious characters
in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>He did not see the man with the gloves, for
that individual, as soon as he had seen the reporter
stop in front of the building Peter entered,
had hidden himself in a nearby doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton to himself,
as he entered the hallway.</p>
<p>It was quite dark, in spite of the lamp. He
went up the first flight, and found himself in a
narrow hall, from which several doors opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder which room he went into,&rdquo; thought
the reporter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t knock at all of them and
ask. Few of the Chinese understand English
when you want &rsquo;em to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>He decided to go to the top floor, and get an
idea of the layout of the place, before making
any inquiries. So he continued up the next flight
of stairs. The floor above was like the second,
except that the portal of one room was open.
Going past it Mr. Newton peered inside. He saw
two solemn-faced Chinese playing a card game,
and smoking long-stemmed pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s not in there,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the next floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up he went, listening now and then to see if
he was being followed. He could hear no footsteps,
and there was good reason for it, as the
man with the gloves, who had glided into the
hallway a few seconds after Mr. Newton had
entered, had slipped over his heavy shoes a pair
of large felt slippers that made no sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s walking right into the trap!&rdquo; said the
man with the gloves. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton reached the top hall. He saw a
number of doors. At the end of the corridor, in
front of one portal, there burned a dim hanging-lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; the reporter mused.</p>
<p>He reached the door. He was about to knock
when he happened to glance up.</p>
<p>He was startled to see confronting him, painted
on a panel of the door, a large blue hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A VAIN QUEST</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this is the place,&rdquo; thought the reporter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather odd, though, that they dare
adopt such a sign as that openly, when they must
know we are on their track in connection with
the safe-robbery. I wonder if I&rsquo;d better go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was answered for him, as, at that
instant, the door opened. Mr. Newton saw before
him a room brightly lighted. Around a table
were seated four men. In front of them was
the envelope which had been obtained by Peter
at the cigar store. Peter was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired one of the men, a short, slim
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for a friend, a young man,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton, rather taken by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know who it was. He brought this
envelope. But it&rsquo;s no good. You can&rsquo;t fool us!&rdquo;
exclaimed a voice behind Mr. Newton, and the
next instant the reporter was shoved into the
room by the man with the gloves, who entered
after him, and shut the door, which closed with
a snap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>At first the reporter was startled with the suddenness
of it all, and he was not a little alarmed.
He knew he was alone, and in the power of the
gang he had sought to run down. He was also
in the worst part of the city, where cries for help
might go unheeded, since there were hourly fightings
among the inhabitants, to which cries the police,
if they heard them, paid no attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton thought he had been a little hasty.
However, he resolved to put the best face on it
he could, and not to seem frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the short, slim man again.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve seen your friend isn&rsquo;t here, what
can we do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might give me back the stolen deed, for
one thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton, boldly, &ldquo;and
your friend Noddy might explain something in
connection with a certain safe-robbery, while as
for Mr. Perkins, he might tell what his plans are
in connection with that land grab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden stir among the men, as
Mr. Newton said this. Two of the men got up
from their chairs, and started toward the reporter,
but a gesture from the man with the
gloves restrained him. The latter then said,
slowly and deliberately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you know a heap about us, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know more than you think I do, Noddy,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton, coolly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t play this trick right,&rdquo; sneered
Noddy. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t opened that envelope, but
we know it doesn&rsquo;t contain the agreement we
want and intend to have. To prove you that, I&rsquo;ll
tear it up without opening it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he did, throwing the pieces into a coal
box that stood in a far corner of the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next place,&rdquo; went on Noddy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
gone a little too far in following our messenger
here. We expected you would do so, however,
and made our plans accordingly. Now you&rsquo;re
here you may have to stay longer than you
counted on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton, speaking
as lightly as he could, though he confessed
afterward he felt no little alarm. &ldquo;Remember,
we&rsquo;re in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! We&rsquo;re not in New York! We&rsquo;re in
Chinatown, and that makes all the difference in
the world!&rdquo; exclaimed Noddy. &ldquo;Get the cords,
Ned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tallest of the four men rose, and went to
a closet. He came back quickly with a long, thin,
but very stout rope under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasten him up now!&rdquo; commanded Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without a fight!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton.
He backed into a corner, and stood ready to defend
himself. He caught sight of an iron poker
near the coal-box, and grabbed it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be some broken heads if you
touch me!&rdquo; the reporter cried.</p>
<p>The four men, with Ned, holding the cords, in
the lead, hung back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of him!&rdquo; yelled Noddy. &ldquo;You
can get the better of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton swung the poker menacingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it yourself, if you&rsquo;re so anxious to get a
cracked cocoanut!&rdquo; muttered one of the men to
Noddy.</p>
<p>Noddy made a motion as if to grapple with the
reporter. But Mr. Newton, with a sudden motion,
advanced, and stood in front of his enemy.
Noddy reached his hand back toward his pocket,
as if to draw a weapon. With a quickness that
could not be guarded against, Mr. Newton swung
the poker around, and brought it down on Noddy&rsquo;s
arm, making the fellow howl with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo; the man yelled.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton took advantage of the confusion
which his attack had caused. He sprang to the
door, and, with three blows from his weapon had
shattered the lock. He threw the portal open,
and dashed out into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; yelled Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too late!&rdquo; called back the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this!&rdquo; Noddy&rsquo;s voice
sounded through the passageway, as Mr. Newton
sped away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just begun our
campaign against your friends. Our next move
will not be so easy on you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The noise of the blows on the door had brought
a score or more of frightened Chinese from their
rooms in the building, and they crowded into
the halls and on the stairs as the reporter hurried
out. This gave Mr. Newton one advantage,
for the opening of the doors made the passages
light.</p>
<p>In their frightened, cackling voices the Chinese
sounded not unlike a lot of scared hens and roosters.
In their anxiety to see what was going on,
and perhaps in a desire to escape from what they
evidently considered a raid by the police, some of
the Celestials got in Mr. Newton&rsquo;s way. He
pushed through the throng, knocking some of the
Mongolians over, at which they yelled louder
than before.</p>
<p>Out into Pell Street sped the reporter, expecting
to be pursued by some of the gang. But
when he had reached the middle of the thoroughfare,
which, even at the midnight hour, was well
filled with people, he saw that no one was after
him.</p>
<p>His sudden exit from the house, and the noise
he left behind him, seemed to attract no attention,
as the people of that neighborhood were
used to all sorts of queer affairs, and it was considered
impolite, in Pell Street, to inquire too
closely into your neighbor&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a lucky and rather narrow escape,&rdquo;
mused Mr. Newton, as he made his way
toward the Bowery. &ldquo;I guess I made a mistake
in going up against that gang alone. I&rsquo;ll know
better next time. I&rsquo;ve failed on this occasion,
and we are as far off as ever from getting the
deed, but I have another plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Thinking Larry might be anxious to know the
result of his attempt, Mr. Newton went to his
friend&rsquo;s house. Beyond telling him he had failed,
the older reporter did not acquaint Larry with
the details of the attack and the escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose became of Peter?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he was somewhere in the house,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;It was like the other
houses in Chinatown, a regular rabbit warren,
with half a dozen entrances. He could go in one
way, and out another. But I&rsquo;ll land &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you plan to do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I haven&rsquo;t made up my
mind,&rdquo; Mr. Newton replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of up
against a stone wall. I want to sleep over it.
Then, perhaps, I shall hit on something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now nearly one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
Larry and Mr. Newton had been standing out in
front of the Dexter apartments, for Larry did
not want his mother to know about the quest,
fearing she would worry over it. So, when Mr.
Newton called on him, the two had gone outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything more now,&rdquo; remarked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I guess I&rsquo;ll go home, and go to bed,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all tired out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Bidding Larry good-night, Mr. Newton
started off down the street. The neighborhood
was rather poorly lighted, the lamps being few
and far between. Pondering over the strange
mix-up he had become involved in, the reporter
was proceeding along rather absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly his attention was attracted by someone
in the house opposite him opening a window,
and shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves! Murder! Fire! Police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like trouble,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I seem to be going to put in a full night
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Help!&rdquo; the voice, which was
that of a woman, continued to yell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being
robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton placed his fingers to his lips, and
blew a long, shrill whistle. He thought if there
was a policeman in the neighborhood he would
hear it, and hurry to the woman&rsquo;s aid. Meanwhile
Mr. Newton decided to do what he could
singlehanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s robbers!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;They
are trying to get into my room, and steal my diamonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the house. I heard them run downstairs,
and they&rsquo;re hiding in the dining-room.
Oh, please, dear, good, kind Mr. Man, won&rsquo;t you
save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any burglars will remain
around long with that screaming going on,&rdquo;
thought Mr. Newton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>By this time windows all over the neighborhood
were going up, heads were poked out, and
half a score of voices asked what the trouble was.
One excited man fired his revolver.</p>
<p>Several policemen came up on the run, and,
seeing Mr. Newton, who was the only person in
the street at that time, they all made a dash for
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve caught you!&rdquo; one of the bluecoats
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton, calmly.
&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be state&rsquo;s prison for yours,&rdquo; the officer
went on, taking a firmer grip of Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the one at all!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman
who had given the first alarm. &ldquo;He was going
to capture the burglar for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What burglar?&rdquo; cried the policemen, in a
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one in the dining-room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton rapidly explained what had happened.
One of the officers took a closer look at
the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him!&rdquo; the bluecoat exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
on the <i>Leader</i>. Come on, boys, let&rsquo;s get the burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The officers, thinking there would be a chance
to distinguish themselves, went up the steps of
the house, the woman having called to them that
she would come down, and open the door. When
the policemen got inside they made a careful
search all over the premises, but could find no
burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard one!&rdquo; the woman insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you heard a noise,&rdquo; corrected one
of the policemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was just the kind of a noise a burglar
would make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there came a series of thumps from
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; cried the woman.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers made a rush for the passageway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SETTING A TRAP</span></h2>
<p>The sounds increased in loudness. There
seemed to be a struggle going on in the hall,
which was dark, and Mr. Newton, hearing the
scuffle, thought perhaps he might get a burglar
story after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; cried one of the policemen.</p>
<p>The words were followed by a long drawn-out
and plaintive howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the burglar!&rdquo; exclaimed another bluecoat,
as he and his companions entered the dining-room,
where the woman had lighted the gas.</p>
<p>The officer held up a big cat, whose head was
fast inside a milk pitcher. The animal, in search
of a drink, had stuck its nose into the receptacle,
and had been caught. In its efforts to free itself
it had thumped the pitcher over the floor, producing
the sounds which had alarmed the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s my Teddy!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed.
&ldquo;I wonder how I will ever get the pitcher off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; replied a bluecoat. With a
blow of his club he broke the pitcher without
hurting the cat, which, as soon as it was released,
ran, and hid under the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m much obliged to all of you,&rdquo; the
woman said. &ldquo;I was sure I was going to be murdered
by a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry it wasn&rsquo;t one,&rdquo; said one of the
officers. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he hastened to add, &ldquo;not
wishin&rsquo; ye any harm, of course, mum, but we&rsquo;d
like the chance of catchin&rsquo; a burglar, seein&rsquo; as
how times is a little dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing among themselves the policemen
filed out. In the meanwhile quite a crowd had
gathered outside, for the rumor had spread that
a woman had been robbed and murdered, and
scores of neighbors had hastily dressed and come
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; several persons exclaimed,
as the officers came out. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the burglar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left him there,&rdquo; replied one of the policemen.
&ldquo;He lives there. His name is Mr. Thomas
Cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; a score or more exclaimed, much disappointed.
Then, after hearing all the particulars,
they went back to bed.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton remained to get the woman&rsquo;s
name, as he intended to write up a funny story of
the burglar scare. It was past two o&rsquo;clock when
he reached home, and he slept so soundly that he
was late getting to work next morning. However,
Mr. Emberg said nothing, when told of the
cat episode, and told the reporter to take his time,
and turn out a good account of the &ldquo;burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Larry, as did the other reporters, had a busy
time of it that day. There were several fires,
a number of accidents, and a shooting case. Mr.
Newton had scarcely a chance to speak to his
friend, and Larry was anxious for the last edition
to get under way, so he might inquire
whether Mr. Newton had thought up any new
plan to get back the deed and bring the safe-robbers
to justice.</p>
<p>When the last forms had gone to the stereotypers,
and no other news remained to go into
the paper, unless something big, necessitating an
extra, should occur, Larry found a chance to ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Newton, have you thought of a
plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;It occurred to me
only a little while ago. I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It involves another visit to our chemist friend,
Mr. Hosfer,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll
enlist his aid in this case. He&rsquo;s a sort of amateur
detective among his other accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that evening they went to the chemist&rsquo;s
house. They found him in the midst of his bottles
and test tubes, working away, while a most
unpleasant odor pervaded the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute,&rdquo; called the chemist,
as Larry and Mr. Newton entered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
seem to get this mixture just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems plenty strong enough,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Newton, holding his handkerchief to his
nose. &ldquo;What in the world is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something with which to take out inkstains.
Do you object to the smell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t exactly what you would call a
perfume,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be strong, you know,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hosfer. &ldquo;Otherwise it would not work. But I&rsquo;ll
stop for a while, and talk to you. I suppose you
have some horrible, mysterious, sensational,
blood-curdling, hair-raising, nerve-racking case
on your hands. Oh, you reporters are the most
terrible fellows in the world! Living amid blood
and thunder, it&rsquo;s a wonder to me you ever sleep,&rdquo;
and laughing heartily, in strange contrast to his
rather exciting language, Mr. Hosfer came forward,
and shook hands with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smell don&rsquo;t come off,&rdquo; he said, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish some of it would go out,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you open a window or&mdash;or
make some other odor take its place? It smells
like a skunk factory in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll fix it,&rdquo; replied the chemist. From
several bottles he poured a mixture into a glass.
This he stirred up, and then put into an atomizer.
He sprayed the stuff all around the apartment,
and soon a most agreeable odor was noticeable in
the air of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; came from Larry. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An imitation of violet perfume,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Hosfer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;It smells like the real thing,&rdquo; ventured Mr.
Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like most perfumes. Very few of
them ever see the flowers they&rsquo;re named after,&rdquo;
commented the chemist. &ldquo;Now what horrible
happening brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly horrible,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s something of a mystery,
and it may develop into a sensational case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t keep away from sensationalism and terrible
things if you tried. Now tell me all about
it. I like excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember me coming here with that
blue paper?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The one with nitro-glycerine stains
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one. Well, now I want you to find
something that will take those stains from a man&rsquo;s
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that would be hard work. Those acid
stains go in pretty deep, and stay until the skin
wears off, as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have something that will pretty
nearly take them out, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess I could find some chemical that
would make them fade out somewhat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want you to do. When you
find it you&rsquo;re going to put an advertisement in
the paper stating that you can remove all sorts of
stains from hands and faces. In short, you&rsquo;re
going to become a sort of skin doctor for a
while,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked the chemist.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Newton told Mr. Hosfer the main
facts in connection with the safe-robbery, and the
theft of Larry&rsquo;s deed. He related how they had
gotten on the track of the blue-handed man, but
how the quest for the deed had failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid if we cause his arrest we will never
see the deed again,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Besides
we really have no evidence that would stand in
court if they got a clever lawyer to defend Noddy,
as he is called. We must work without the aid
of the authorities for the present. We want to
get the deed back first. Then we want some
clews to the others concerned in the safe-robbery,
and, last, I want to get on the track of the land
operators, for I am sure there is a big swindle
going on there that concerns the Board of
Aldermen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help you by becoming a skin doctor?&rdquo;
asked the chemist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;We will
put the advertisement in the paper. Unless I am
very much mistaken it will be seen and read by
Noddy, the blue-handed man. I am sure he
would only be too glad to get rid of the stains,
and so save himself the trouble of wearing gloves.
Besides, he knows we are after him, and that
his hands offer a rather easy mark of identification.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he could go to some other doctor who
makes a business of removing stains from hands
and faces,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Hosfer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he could, but I don&rsquo;t believe he will. I
have no doubt he has thought of that plan, but,
you see, the trouble is he wants to keep under
cover. If he went to an ordinary doctor he might
be asked embarrassing questions, such as how
the stains came on his hands. This might lead
to unpleasant results. No, Noddy wants to keep
under cover, and we&rsquo;ll respect his wishes, at least
for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put in the advertisement about you,&rdquo;
Mr. Newton went on, &ldquo;that all cases are strictly
confidential, and that no questions are asked.
That will catch Noddy, and he&rsquo;ll walk into our
trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will I do when I get him?&rdquo; asked the
chemist. &ldquo;Preserve him in alcohol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll make no attempt to capture
him,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;That is, at first. If
he calls at your laboratory use some of the preparation
which you are to make, on his hands.
Don&rsquo;t make it very strong, and take only a little
of the stain off. Tell him he will have to come
again. In this way he can be induced to pay several
visits to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile I can be working my end of
the game. Have all the visits at night. Tell him
you can treat him at no other time. That will
give me a chance to be on hand. I&rsquo;ll follow him
when he leaves here, and I may be able to get on
the track of the deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a good scheme,&rdquo; commented the
chemist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right to work on the stain-removing
mixture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll look after the advertisement,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose a lot of people come to have stains
removed?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;What am I
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, remove the stains, of course,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;You may to be able to make a lot
of money out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lose a lot of valuable time,&rdquo; said the chemist.
&ldquo;But never mind, I&rsquo;ll do it to help you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day there appeared in several papers
an advertisement to the effect that the celebrated
chemist, Mr. Hosfer, would remove stains of all
kinds from the hands or face for a moderate sum.
All cases were to be treated in strict confidence,
and no questions were to be asked, it was stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that ought to catch him,&rdquo; said Mr.
Newton, as he read it over.</p>
<p>It was several days before he was able to pay
Mr. Hosfer a visit again. When he and Larry
called on the chemist they found him busier than
ever in his laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;Say,
I&rsquo;m sorry I ever consented to this. I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ve
removed stains from a hundred hands in the last
two days! I&rsquo;m nearly exhausted by the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did Noddy come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Hosfer,
laying aside a test tube, and sitting down in a
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ELECTION NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; the chemist continued, &ldquo;how
many people there were in New York who had
stains that they desired removed from their hands
or faces. It&rsquo;s astonishing, that&rsquo;s what it is. Men
and women came here, covered with ink, or else
marked with acids and chemicals, and wanted
me to make &rsquo;em look nice again so they could
go to a dance, or appear in public. Mothers
brought their sons and daughters, all marked up
from playing with paint or something else, and
wanted me to make &rsquo;em right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did Noddy come?&rdquo; insisted Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;m coming to that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hosfer,
&ldquo;but I have to tell it in my own way. After
about a hundred ordinary people had called on
me, I began to think our trap was a failure, since
the bird we wanted did not come. In the meanwhile
I had used up about ten dollars&rsquo; worth of
chemicals removing stains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t any of them offer to pay you?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one,&rdquo; replied the chemist, sadly. &ldquo;I
guess they thought this was a dispensary for the
poor. Well, never mind that. But last evening,
just as I was about to close up the shop, there
came a ring at the bell, and in came a man, who,
the minute I set eyes on him, I knew to be the
person we wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Noddy, eh?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who it was. He had on a pair of
gloves, and he seemed quite nervous. He wanted
to know if it was all straight about the advertisement,
and I told him it was. That I wouldn&rsquo;t ask
any questions, but would remove any stains he
might have, and only charge him a small sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said he didn&rsquo;t care what it cost. Then he
pulled off his gloves, and showed me the bluest
pair of hands you ever saw. The moment I saw
&rsquo;em I knew he was our man. But I didn&rsquo;t say
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming again?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This very evening,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hosfer. &ldquo;I
used a weak solution of acid, and only took part
of the stain off. I told him he would have to
come back for three evenings, and he promised to
be here about nine o&rsquo;clock to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost that now,&rdquo; observed Larry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
better get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Now
this is my plan. Have you some place where
you can hide us, Mr. Hosfer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to follow Noddy when he goes
from here. I think I can do it with better success
than I did in the case of Peter. I must find out
where he lives, since I am convinced he has the
deed in his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Larry can go into the next room,&rdquo;
said the chemist. &ldquo;You can hear everything that
goes on in here, and when Noddy starts to leave,
after I have treated him, you can be all ready to
follow. He&rsquo;ll never see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; spoke Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go in now. He may be along at
any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had hardly entered the room opening off
from the laboratory when there came a knock at
the door, and Noddy entered.</p>
<p>Through a crack in the portal Mr. Newton
watched the blue-handed man. Noddy seemed ill
at ease. He still wore his gloves, but he took
them off soon after entering the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll try the second application,&rdquo; Larry
and Mr. Newton heard Mr. Hosfer say. &ldquo;This
will almost do the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll soon be done,&rdquo; Noddy said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of wearing these gloves around.
You see,&rdquo; he volunteered, &ldquo;I spilled some bluing
on my hands as I was helping my wife with the
wash, and it looks rather bad; that&rsquo;s the reason
I want to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon fix you,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Hosfer, paying
no attention to the explanation Noddy offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The chemist applied several solutions to Noddy&rsquo;s
hands, and, under his treatment, the blue
color faded somewhat. The chemist knew it
could not be taken out entirely, but he did not
consider it his place to tell the man so. It was
a case of wits being matched against wits, and
the chemist favored the side of justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can do for you to-night,&rdquo; Mr.
Hosfer remarked at length, speaking in loud
tones, so Mr. Newton, in the next room, could
hear him. &ldquo;Come to-morrow or next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could finish with me,&rdquo; remarked
Noddy. &ldquo;I want to get rid of this stain, and go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing the best I can,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hosfer.
&ldquo;Yours is a bad case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal worse than you think,&rdquo; muttered
the man.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Noddy left the house. Mr.
Newton was close after him, trailing him along
the half-deserted streets. Larry had been left
behind, with instructions to await the older reporter&rsquo;s
return.</p>
<p>For a number of blocks Mr. Newton had no
trouble in keeping after Noddy. The suspected
safe-robber wore a light hat, which was conspicuous
among the throng of people on the thoroughfares,
most of whom had on dark headgear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll land him this time,&rdquo; murmured Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not run my head into a Chinese
den again, though. He seems to be heading for
a respectable part of town. I guess our trick&rsquo;s
going to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now about ten o&rsquo;clock. Noddy had
reached Union Square, and was crossing the
small park near Broadway. Close behind him,
taking care not to be seen, was Mr. Newton.
There was quite a throng in the streets, and many
vehicles.</p>
<p>Suddenly an automobile, the driver of which
seemed to lose his head, rammed a trolley car.
The crash was heard for some distance, and,
though no one was hurt in the accident, it caused
a blockade. Noddy halted to see what the trouble
was, and Mr. Newton found himself on the outskirts
of quite a crowd that was collecting.</p>
<p>Just then Noddy turned, and, by some chance,
looked straight at the reporter who was trailing
him. One glance was enough for Noddy. He
seemed to sink down amid the throng. Mr. Newton
made his way farther into the midst of the
crowd, but all traces of Noddy were lost. There
was no sign of the light hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s bad luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I guess our plan&rsquo;s knocked in the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was he mistaken, for Noddy did not come
back to the chemist&rsquo;s the next night. The trap
had proved a failure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to let the thing go for a
while,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton to Larry, on the afternoon
following the unsuccessful trailing of
Noddy. &ldquo;Election&rsquo;s coming on now, and we&rsquo;ll
both be pretty busy. I don&rsquo;t believe the gang
will dare to do anything, now that they know
we&rsquo;re after them. I think we can let things rest
for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry agreed with this idea. As Mr. Newton
had said, there was plenty of work about the
<i>Leader</i> office now. There was a three-sided campaign
on that year. The Democrats had their
candidates, as did the Republicans. Then there
was an Independent ticket in the field. These
men had a number of issues which they wanted
to see win. Altogether it was what politicians
call a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; campaign.</p>
<p>It was drawing to a close, however. In another
week there would come the election, when
all questions would be settled.</p>
<p>Larry had his first experience in a big newspaper
office during the most exciting time; that
is, on an election night.</p>
<p>For several days the older reporters had been
making up tables on which the returns were to
be set down as they came in from each district.
Mr. Emberg and his assistants were working
early and late to get things into shape.</p>
<p>Election day passed itself off quietly enough.
The political writers were kept busy, telling how
things seemed to look according to early information,
but as for forecasting who was elected no
one could do that. All day the battle of the ballots
continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The <i>Leader</i>, being an afternoon paper, was going
to issue a morning extra. To get this out the
men would have to work all night, in addition to
being on duty all day. It was hard on them, but
they didn&rsquo;t mind it once a year.</p>
<p>No sooner had the last edition gone to press
in the afternoon than preparations were made for
getting out the next morning&rsquo;s extra. The men
in charge of the tables got them ready, spreading
them out on large boards. The tables looked
like big-sized war maps, with little blocks and
spaces for each election district, a place devoted
to each candidate, and squares where the total
vote might be cast up.</p>
<p>In the different polling places the last ballots
were being put into boxes. The clerks and
judges, with their eye on the clock, stood ready
to call &ldquo;time,&rdquo; when the hour of sunset should
be marked. The last voters were being corraled.
In a few minutes the big contest would be over,
all excepting the counting of the tickets.</p>
<p>At each polling place policemen were stationed.
It was the duty of the bluecoats to take charge of
the ballot box, after the tickets had been counted.
The officers had blanks, prepared by the different
papers, and these were brought to City Hall,
where the tally was taken.</p>
<p>The newspapers had men at this point to make
a record of the votes each candidate received.
This record was quickly transmitted to the office,
either by messenger or telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>As he had had no experience at this work
Larry was only a sort of reserve man, being held
in readiness to be sent out on ordinary news. As
the night was dull, except for election, he had a
chance to see how the paper got the returns.</p>
<p>At the big tables half a dozen men were stationed,
anxiously waiting. With pencils poised
they stood ready to jot down the figures under
each candidate&rsquo;s name. It was very quiet, and
there was no excitement. Each man knew what
he had to do, and was ready to do it.</p>
<p>In rushed a messenger. He carried a long slip.
This he handed to the man at the first table, the
&ldquo;caller-off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Seventeenth assembly district,&rdquo;
cried the reporter, and then in low but distinct
tones he read each candidate&rsquo;s name, and gave his
vote. In the proper squares the markers set the
figures down. There were several sets of tables,
and, as soon as one was filled, the slip was passed
to the set of men at the next one.</p>
<p>In this way hundreds of districts were recorded.
Through the night the work went on.
As soon as a district was completed the talliers
would cut it out from the sheet, and call off the
figures to another man, who sat at an adding machine.
This man quickly computed the total vote,
and it was set down.</p>
<p>Then the section of table was rushed upstairs
to the composing room, where the printers
quickly, on their type-setting machines, made a
duplicate of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Toward the end the work became hard and tiring.
The returns came piling in, and the nerve
tension under which the men worked was tremendous.
But there was little excitement.</p>
<p>Finally the returns were all in. Then came
the tedious task of figuring the totals, for on this
depended the result of the election, and finding
out which party had won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Click! Click! Click!&rdquo; went the adding machines.
Number after number the reporters
called off. Upstairs in the composing room the
type-machines were working overtime.</p>
<p>Everyone was under a great strain. Seconds
seemed like minutes. At times, during a lull, the
ticking of the clock sounded like the firing of a
rifle. In corners of the room experts were figuring
pluralities and majorities. Other reporters
were writing interviews with winning or losing
candidates. Still others were describing the
scenes on the streets, the torchlight processions,
the happenings at the political headquarters, and
telling what the effect of the Board of Aldermen
changing from one party to the other would be.</p>
<p>There was not an idle person in the room. The
city editor was here, there, everywhere. He
seemed to be carrying the responsibility of a
dozen men. He was telling everyone to hurry, as
it was time for the morning extra to be out on
the street.</p>
<p>At last the final additions were made. The last
computations were completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Independents have won!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came the shouts from outside.</p>
<p>The last form was sent down. The stereotypers
were working like mad. The hungry
presses were waiting. The engine was at full
steam.</p>
<p>Out from the casting machine came the half-curved
plates of type from which the papers were
to be printed. Half-naked men clamped them
upon the cylinders. They contained the thousands
of figures that told the story of the battle of
the ballots. The last plate was slapped into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; cried the foreman.</p>
<p>A bell rang. The engine started. There was
a subdued roar. There was a rattle, a bang, a
throb of the basement floor. Then came a shrill
screech as the belts gripped the wheels, and the
machinery started. In another instant the roar
became a steady thunder, and hundreds of papers
a minute began falling from the presses.</p>
<p>The election extra was out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A QUEER LETTER</span></h2>
<p>It was just getting dawn when the reporters,
editors, and copy readers, who had worked so
hard on the extra, stopped, and had a breathing
spell. Down in the street the newsboys were
crying their wares in shrill tones. The thoroughfares
were almost deserted, however, save
by a few night-workers who were hurrying home.
In a little while, though, they would be thronged
by crowds anxious to buy papers, to scan the returns,
for not everyone remains up late enough
to find out who is elected.</p>
<p>Larry thought, now that the paper was out,
there would be a chance for all hands to go to
bed, and get some sleep. But as the <i>Leader</i> was
an afternoon paper, and the election extra was a
sort of side line, the entire force, without having
had a wink of sleep, had to turn in and get
ready for the regular issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before we do that we&rsquo;ll have breakfast,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Emberg. So he took the crowd of
reporters to a nearby restaurant, where some hot
coffee and wheat cakes with maple syrup made
everyone feel a bit fresher, though there were
many sleepy eyes in the city room that day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Larry thought he never would be able to stick
it out. Every now and then, in the midst of his
writing, he would find his head nodding toward
the desk, and he would just catch himself in time.
He looked around somewhat sheepishly at such
times, but no one seemed to be noticing him. As
a matter of fact everyone else had momentary
failings.</p>
<p>Aside from going over the returns, and making
some corrections, getting interviews from defeated
candidates and leaders who told how they
had been whipped, and talks with successful ones,
who told how the people were sure to be benefited
by the new party, there was not much news that
day.</p>
<p>A few fires, none of them very big, several
robberies, and a number of accidents, one of
which proved fatal, made up the day&rsquo;s happenings.
Usually a general lack of news was something
to be regarded as an undesirable happening,
but the day after election even the editors were
too weary to want many items.</p>
<p>The paper closed early that afternoon, and
Larry went straight home, ate a hearty supper, and
then tumbled into bed. He slept like a top until
the sun, streaming in at his window, awakened
him, and then he felt as if a few hours more
would have done him no harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>But he felt freshened up, and, making a hearty
breakfast, went to the office. He was among the
first to arrive. Mr. Newton was there, busily engaged
in writing at his desk. He looked up when
Larry entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo; he asked, and Larry shook
his head, knowing his friend referred to the
deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get busy on that again, now,&rdquo;
spoke Mr. Newton, coming over to where Larry
was. &ldquo;It will not do to let the gang think we
have given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait, and see if they don&rsquo;t do something
first,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;They may
show us a little more of their hand, and give us
a better clew to work on. I guess we can&rsquo;t depend
any more on Mr. Hosfer to help us. He
will be suspected by the gang from now on.
We&rsquo;ll have to think up a new plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;ll be after me again, to
sign the deed?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume so. They must have your signature,
as well as that of your mother. In fact,
I doubt if they could get possession of the property,
even if you and your mother did sign. You
see, it belongs to you, your mother, and the other
children jointly. It would be necessary for you all
to sign, and, as you and the other children are not
of age, your signatures would be of no value.
The courts would have to be appealed to to appoint
a guardian for you. But the gang evidently
think that if they get your signature, and that of
your mother, they can pass the deed off for genuine
on some unsuspecting purchaser, without
waiting for the other names.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea about why they are so
anxious to get the land?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except I am sure there is some big
move afoot in that part of town. It concerns the
city, but what it is I can&rsquo;t learn, though I&rsquo;ve tried
in all the ways I know. I&rsquo;m only afraid some
other paper will find out before I do, and get a
beat on me as well as spoiling our chance to get
the deed back. But that&rsquo;s one of the risks you
take in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only thing to do is to wait?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was three days after this that a strange letter
came, addressed to Larry. And an odd
enough one it was. Instead of the address being
written, or printed by hand, or on a typewriter,
the name, number, and street had all been cut
from some paper or book, and pasted on the envelope.
It was a slow and laborious piece of
work, and the persons who sent it must have had
plenty of time at their disposal. At first Larry
thought it was a joke.</p>
<p>But when he had opened the envelope, and
taken out the single sheet of paper it contained,
he was sure it was no joke, but something quite
different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he whistled, softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The words in the letter had been cut separately
from a newspaper, and pasted one after another
to make sentences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is odd,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;I wonder why
anyone who wanted to write me a letter could
not do it in the usual way. This was a lot of
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when he had read the missive through he
was more puzzled than ever. It seemed to be
nothing but a lot of words jumbled together.
There was no sense to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was Valentine&rsquo;s day, I&rsquo;d think someone
was sending me a new-fashioned kind,&rdquo; thought
Larry. &ldquo;But as it is, I guess it&rsquo;s a Chinese puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he read the letter through slowly.
This is what he saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To impossible the suddenness boy forever

</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t foolish, I&rsquo;d like to know
what is,&rdquo; remarked Larry.</p>
<p>The oftener he read it the stranger it seemed.
Then he turned it upside down, and tried to read
it backward, but it was as bad one way as the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll throw it away,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll save it, and show Mr. Newton,&rdquo; he said,
on second thought. &ldquo;Maybe some of the fellows
in the office sent it to me for fun. He&rsquo;ll probably
know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning he took the strange letter
to the office with him, having said nothing to his
mother about it, for fear she would worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d say it came from the Black Hand society,
or the Mafia,&rdquo; he thought, as the papers
were full of stories concerning these blackmailers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton, when he
greeted Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; replied the lad. &ldquo;Someone
has been having a little fun with me, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry produced the oddly-constructed letter,
and gave it to Mr. Newton. At first the older
reporter glanced carelessly at it. Then he looked
more carefully over it, and a puzzled look came
into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make any sense out of it?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly. That is, not right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you ever expect to be able to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all nonsense. Just as if I took a lot
of words at random, and jotted them down. It
reads as good backwards as it does frontwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it does. That&rsquo;s the way they intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who intended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The persons who sent you this cipher message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a cipher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is, and it&rsquo;s evidently a very easy
one, or the gang would never have sent it. They
evidently want to scare you a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the gang that stole the deed
sent this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you read what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at once, but I&rsquo;m going to try. They&rsquo;re
laughing at us, Larry, but we&rsquo;ll laugh at them
soon. Now to solve this cipher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SOLVING THE CIPHER</span></h2>
<p>Much as he would have liked to go to work
on it at once, Mr. Newton was obliged to postpone
his beginning of solving the problem. There
were a number of stories he had to go out on, and
Larry, likewise, was kept busy. It was late in the
afternoon when they found a chance to speak of
the strange letter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, &ldquo;suppose
you come over to my house this evening, and
we&rsquo;ll tackle the cipher. It may be important for
us to solve it as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Larry.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton lived in a sort of bachelor hotel.
He had several rooms, and when Larry called
that evening, he found his friend seated at a large
table, on which were spread out a number of
sheets of paper, several pencils, and some books.
In the center of the table was the cipher letter
Larry had received, which he had given Mr. Newton
that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you making any headway?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I
have been studying the thing, trying to see where
to start. Take a look at it yourself, and see if
it suggests anything to you. Two heads are better
than one, any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry puzzled over the paper for several minutes,
but was obliged to admit that the more he
looked at it the more of a puzzle it became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a cipher is it, anyhow?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;What is a cipher? I&rsquo;ve often heard of
them, but I never saw one before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cipher is merely a message from one person
to another,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;It is written
in such a way as to prevent any third person,
in whose hand it may fall, from learning
the contents. Each of the persons in the secret
has a key to the cipher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are simple ciphers and elaborate ones.
There is one used by the United States war and
other officials that is very elaborate, and when
messages are sent in it, there is a lot of work getting
at the real meaning. That is done to prevent
enemies learning what the message contains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not suppose this cipher is very difficult.
The trouble is, it is so simple that it is puzzling.
I have tried a number of methods used on
fairly hard ciphers, but I can make nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world do you suppose they wrote
in cipher for, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To try and scare you a bit, I reckon. The
more mystery they throw around it the worse
they think they have you frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you tried to solve it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first I went on the supposition that it
was a letter cipher. That is, that you must pick
out certain letters in each word, and then put
them together to make sense. I tried several different
methods on this line, but all I get is a lot
of words as meaningless as those in the cipher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take out all the words that seem
to have any bearing on our matters. I&rsquo;ll set them
down, and try to make sense of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, with Larry to help, Mr. Newton
wrote down the following: blue, marks, ink,
farm, door, and deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are all that I see that concern us directly,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;There is &lsquo;blue,&rsquo; for the blue-handed
man; &lsquo;marks,&rsquo; which he had on his hand;
&lsquo;ink,&rsquo; which might refer to Mr. Hosfer&rsquo;s attempts;
&lsquo;farm,&rsquo; which certainly refers to you;
&lsquo;door,&rsquo; which is what had the blue mark on it
when I went into Chinatown; and &lsquo;deed,&rsquo; which
is what we&rsquo;re after. Now we&rsquo;ll see if I can get
anything out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton tried by combining various letters
in each word to get a meaning from the cipher.
It was of no avail. Then he started on still another
method.</p>
<p>This was to string all the words together so
they formed a meaningless jumble of letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go along and take every second letter
regardless of the words they are in,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He did this, and after making several selections,
he had this as a result:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>OMOSBEHSDENSBYOEEW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no go,&rdquo; he announced, after staring at
the combination. &ldquo;That would never make sense.
I&rsquo;ll try every third letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he got:</p>
<p>IOIEEDNSOO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck again,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Too many
vowels to get any words that would mean anything
out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he was not discouraged. He tried
the same plan, using respectively the fourth to
the tenth letter in the conglomeration. But each
time he had to admit defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets me,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton, at length. &ldquo;If
I could only stumble on one or two words I think
I could find out the system. The rest would be
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried taking every seventh word?&rdquo;
asked Larry. &ldquo;We boys in the country used to
consider seven a lucky number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it, just for luck, then,&rdquo; spoke Mr.
Newton. He quickly set down every seventh
word, and had this result when he had gone a little
way:</p>
<p>WHO DELIVERY WE FURNACE UP
COWS THE AUTOMOBILE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; commented Mr. Newton. &ldquo;We
can make a sentence of that anyhow. Listen:
&lsquo;We, the furnace who deliver up automobile
cows,&rsquo; though it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try some other way of taking the words,&rdquo;
went on Larry. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better begin at the
end, and work up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll try your plan for a change,&rdquo;
agreed Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Take every seventh word
from the end. This is what we get: &lsquo;Sign be dog
name teapot of evidently,&rsquo; and so on. Not much
to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in very weariness he and Larry sat staring
at the paper which they felt sure contained
a hidden message for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it up,&rdquo; suggested Larry. &ldquo;If they
want to send us any word let them do it in the
right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to give up so easily,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another try at it. Hand
the cipher over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry, who had been scanning the mysterious
paper, passed it across the table to Mr. Newton.
To do so he had to move it in front of a drop
gas lamp. As the paper came between Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
eyes and the light the reporter gave a sudden
cry. He fairly grabbed the paper from
Larry, and looked at it closely. He seemed somewhat
disappointed. Then he held it up to the
light again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you put those marks on this?&rdquo; he asked
of Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These tiny dots on the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched the cipher,&rdquo; said Larry,
wondering what Mr. Newton meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I have it solved!&rdquo; exclaimed
the reporter. &ldquo;I wonder I didn&rsquo;t think of this
before. Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry came around to that side of the table.
He looked through the half-transparent cipher,
and saw below certain of the words a small, black
dot. The dots were made on the back of the document,
and only showed through when it was held
to the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the track at last!&rdquo; cried Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;Here, Larry, you write down the words
I call off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with fingers that trembled so he could
scarcely hold the pencil, Larry set this down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To the boy who found the paper with blue
marks we give you one week to make up your
mind after that look for the loss of the small
one who bears the name of a martyred president
he will be taken from you when you least expect,
sign deed at once.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see. The first sentence is easily
enough set off. &lsquo;To the boy who found the paper
with blue marks.&rsquo; You see, they have simply
used every other word in the cipher. It was so
easy it was hard. Now, then, we&rsquo;ll go on. &lsquo;To
the boy, etc.,&rsquo; that means you. The next sentence
reads: &lsquo;We give you one week to make up
your mind.&rsquo; The rest reads, properly punctuated:
&lsquo;After that, look for the loss of the small
one who bears the name of a martyred President.
He will be taken from you when you least expect.
Sign deed at once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean about the small one
bearing the name of a martyred president?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First consider who were the martyred presidents,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there were Abraham Lincoln, James A.
Garfield, and William McKinley,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone in your family with either of
those names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;of course&mdash;there&rsquo;s Jimmy&mdash;James.
But why do they refer to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton, &ldquo;why
do they? I wish they had not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this looks as if they meant to make
trouble, and force you to do what they want. It
is nothing more nor less than a threat to kidnap
your little brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnap Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they practically threaten unless
you sign the deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can they kidnap persons in New
York, with so many police around?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read enough in the papers of
late how it is done?&rdquo; answered Mr. Newton. &ldquo;It
is very easy, especially for some Italian gang. I
would be on my guard if I were you, and tell
your mother to have an eye out for Jimmy at all
times. But don&rsquo;t scare her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would it do if they did take
Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d find out soon enough,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Newton. &ldquo;How long do you suppose you would
refuse to sign, or your mother&mdash;how long do you
think she would refrain from signing, if she
knew by doing so she could get Jimmy back?
We are fighting a desperate gang, I&rsquo;m afraid, and
we&rsquo;ll have to be on our guard. Be careful of
every move, be suspicious of all strangers, and
keep a lookout for the blue-handed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we notify the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we could, but it would be worse than
useless. In the first place we have nothing but
suspicions and vague threats. The police could
not act on them. Besides you couldn&rsquo;t have a
bluecoat detailed to watch Jimmy all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what we had better do,&rdquo; mused
Larry, who was much alarmed over the turn
things had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have several days yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;They give us a week to make up our minds. In
that time something may turn up. We&rsquo;ve done
enough work for to-night. Let&rsquo;s rest until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, with his brain filled with thoughts of the
possibility of Jimmy&rsquo;s being kidnapped, and pondering
over the strange web he was being tangled
up in, Larry went home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GAS EXPLOSION</span></h2>
<p>It was with no very easy mind that Larry
started for work next morning. Before he left
for the office he warned his mother to keep her
eye on Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s been a lot of automobile accidents
in the streets lately,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want Jimmy to get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can beat an auto running!&rdquo; cried the little
fellow, who overheard his brother&rsquo;s warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better not try it,&rdquo; said Larry.
&ldquo;You might win the first time, if the auto wasn&rsquo;t
going very fast, but the next time the machine
would beat you, Jimmy, and knock you down,
and roll you over in the mud, and, maybe, if it
was a very bad auto, it would make your nose
bleed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Jimmy, with
rather a frightened look on his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay
close to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Satisfied that he had frightened him sufficiently
to make his little brother keep his promise Larry
went to work. All the morning, however, his
thoughts were more on the threatening cipher he
had received, and on the possibility of Jimmy being
kidnapped, than they were on his assignments.
Every time the reporters came in from
police headquarters Larry was afraid lest they
bring in a story of a little boy having been stolen.</p>
<p>But, as the morning wore on, and there was
no bad news, Larry began to feel more relieved,
and he began to think the threat was an idle one,
after all. Still, he recalled that the week was not
yet up. He found a chance to talk with Mr.
Newton in the course of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d better agree to sign the
deed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, getting frightened about
that cipher?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Larry, I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything
you will worry over. If you think you had better
play into the hands of the gang, in order to prevent
the possibility of them kidnapping your
brother, don&rsquo;t let me stop you. All you have to
do is to insert a notice to that effect in the papers.
They are probably watching for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you honestly think they&rsquo;ll try to kidnap
Jimmy?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. It would be a pretty serious
thing for them to do, mixed up as they are in
other crimes. I don&rsquo;t believe Jimmy is in any
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll not sign,&rdquo; decided Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show them I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>It was shortly after one o&rsquo;clock, and the first
edition had gone to press. There had not been
much news, local or foreign, since morning, and
the reporters and editors were taking it a little
easy.</p>
<p>It was a warm afternoon in early September,
and the haze in the air indicated the approach of
a storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like something to break loose
now,&rdquo; observed one of the reporters, who was
lazily lounging on a table, puffing at a corncob
pipe. &ldquo;It was just like this one afternoon when
that big railroad wreck occurred. We thought
we were never going to get any news that day,
when all at once we had more than we could
handle. That&rsquo;s always the way when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; A dull but powerful explosion
sounded through the open windows, startling the
reporters, and causing the one who was speaking
to break off suddenly in his talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something went up that time,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they blasting anywhere around here?&rdquo;
asked the city editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; several replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an explosion
of some sort. Can&rsquo;t be down at one of the forts,
as it sounded too near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that window!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry,
pointing at one that opened on the north side of
the office. &ldquo;See the smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>A dark pall of vapor, like an immense cloud,
overhung a portion of the city, seemingly about
a mile away from the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the gas tanks!&rdquo; cried Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>Just then the automatic fire alarm in the office,
which was connected with the regular city
system, began to tap the bell with quick, impatient
strokes. There was dead silence in the room
while all counted the number of the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 313!&rdquo; exclaimed a reporter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
gas works&mdash;private box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newton, you and Larry with Smith and Robinson,
jump out on that, quick!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Emberg, grabbing for the telephone on his desk.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Phone the story in!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out
an extra if we have to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was giving these orders, which the
four reporters, including Larry, obeyed at once,
the city editor was getting into communication
with the art department on the floor below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send a photographer up to the gas works!&rdquo;
he called. &ldquo;Big explosion there. Try and get
a picture for the last edition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anderson, you get ready to take the story
over the telephone!&rdquo; Mr. Emberg went on.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to grind it out lively!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Anderson got several pencils ready, arranged
his typewriter with a long roll of paper in it, to
avoid the necessity of changing sheets when he
began to write, and sat down in front of a telephone
that was in a booth, where a small table
offered a chance to write out the notes he would
take when the story began coming in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson, call someone on the &rsquo;phone near the
gas works, and see if you can get a line on how
bad it is. We&rsquo;ll issue a bulletin. Sneadly, get
ready to call up the City and St. Elmo&rsquo;s hospitals
as soon as the victims have had a chance to
get there. There&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll probably take
&rsquo;em, because they are the nearest places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes what had been a quiet office
was transformed into a hive of activity. The
reporters were assigned to their tasks, and those
in the city room stood with tense nerves waiting
for the first news that might tell of a frightful
disaster. Mr. Emberg, like a general planning
for battle, had posted all his forces where they
could do the best and quickest work.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jackson, who had gone to the &rsquo;phone
to call up someone near the scene, cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad one, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking with?&rdquo; asked Mr. Emberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a party on the wire who lives about
a block away. He says all the windows in the
neighborhood are broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the windows!&rdquo; broke in Mr.
Emberg. &ldquo;What do they amount to? Is anyone
killed? Find that out, if you can, and tell
what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson listened to what the man at the other
end of the wire was saying. Then he called out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some men were cleaning out a tank that had
been emptied of gas! Some gas leaked in, and
the thing went up! He says he saw a number of
bodies thrown away up into the air, and the report
is that seven men are killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Jackson had ceased speaking Mr. Emberg
was writing out a bulletin to be posted outside
the office, giving a mere statement of the accident,
and announcing that details would be found
in the next issue of the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>An instant later the telephone rang again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer that, Anderson!&rdquo; the city editor exclaimed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably Newton on the wire.
Write fast, tell him to talk fast, and make short
sentences. We only have a few minutes for the
second edition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city editor proved to be a good guesser.
It was Mr. Newton at the other end of the wire,
and he had a partial story.</p>
<p>Briefly told, the accident was that a dozen men
went into one of the big gas-holders to clean from
the bottom an accumulation of oil that prevented
a free flow of the vapor from the outlet pipe. Before
the men entered through a small manhole
in the top, all the gas had been drawn off.</p>
<p>That is, it was supposed all the vapor was out,
but more either leaked in, or some was generated
by the oil in the bottom of the holder. At any
rate there was some vapor in the tank. One of
the men was using his shovel to scrape some of
the dirt from the sides of the holder, when his
implement must have struck sparks from the iron
side of the tank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>There was a terrific explosion that tore the big
tank apart as if it was made of paper, and the
dozen men inside were hurled high into the air
when the top blew off.</p>
<p>As soon as possible men from other parts of
the works ran to aid the unfortunates. Six of the
men had fallen back into the tank, and were lying
on the bottom. Four had been scattered
about the yard, two badly wounded, and two
dead.</p>
<p>It was this scene that confronted Larry, Mr.
Newton, and the other reporters when they
reached the gas plant. A big crowd had collected,
summoned by the sound of the explosion, the
sight of the big smoke-cloud, and the rush of the
fire apparatus. For the latter there was no need,
as after the first terrible burst of flame from the
tank, there was no more blaze.</p>
<p>However, the firemen with their ladders were
soon called on for service. The two wounded
men, who had been picked up and carried into
the office, were now hurried to the hospital in
the police ambulances that had answered the
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get those men out of the tank!&rdquo; the
foreman of the works cried. &ldquo;There may be
some alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A score of men sprang forward as volunteers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the ladders!&rdquo; shouted the chief of the
fire department, who always responded to an
alarm from the gashouse district.</p>
<p>The firemen ran up with them. Two were
placed against the outside of the tank. Up them
swarmed several of the &ldquo;smoke-eaters,&rdquo; as the
firemen are sometimes called. They were preparing
to lower other ladders down on the inside
when they were forced to come away because of
the gas fumes.</p>
<p>Only for a little while, though, did they falter.
Coming down they got their smoke-masks, made
of fine wire sieves, with damp sponges placed in
them. With these over their faces they prepared
to brave death to rescue the men who might yet
remain alive in the tank.</p>
<p>Down into the shattered holder they went, half
a dozen brave men. Into the slimy black oil on
the bottom they dropped. Then, working quickly,
that they might not be overcome by the fumes
that still continued to accumulate in the tank, each
fireman shouldered one of the unconscious forms.
There was no way of telling the living from the
dead until they were carried up, and then down
the ladders to the ground.</p>
<p>Swarming up the rungs with their burdens the
six firemen came. When they reappeared over
the edge of the tank they were met with a loud
cheer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FAMILY HEIRLOOM</span></h2>
<p>Down to the ground the hapless burdens were
carried. Doctors who had been summoned bent
hastily over the motionless forms. Coats and
jackets, dirty from the oil, were torn open, and
skillful hands felt to see if hearts still beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s alive! Hurry him to the hospital!&rdquo;
cried a physician. The man was placed in an ambulance,
which set off, the horse galloping
swiftly.</p>
<p>The other five were past human aid, having
been either burned to death in the sudden rush
of flame, or suffocated as they fell back into the
holder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were twelve men working in the tank!&rdquo;
cried the superintendent of the works, hurrying
up to the chief of the fire department. &ldquo;We have
found only ten. Where are the other two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hurried search was made for the missing
men. Larry joined in, as did Mr. Newton.
There were several piles of lumber in the yard
about the tanks, and behind one of these the bodies
of the two unfortunate men were found. One
was still breathing, and was hurried to the hospital.
The other had expired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>While these things had been going on Mr.
Newton was not idle. As soon as he got any
facts he ran to a telephone, and sent them in to
the office, where Anderson was waiting for them.
Larry, Smith, and Robinson aided in collecting
the facts, sometimes turning them over to Mr.
Newton, or telephoning them in themselves, if he
was busy.</p>
<p>In this way the information of how the accident
occurred was obtained, and from officials in
the office of the works the names of the men were
secured. Meanwhile there were busy times in the
<i>Leader</i> city room.</p>
<p>Waiting until he had a fairly good and connected
account of the accident, Anderson sat
down to a typewriter, and began grinding out
copy. He was a fast operator, and the way his
fingers flew over the keys was a sight to behold.
In short, crisp sentences, but in words that made
a thrilling story, he rattled out the account.</p>
<p>Near him stood Mr. Emberg. As fast as Anderson
had a paragraph written the city editor
would pull out the paper, and clip off what was
written. Meantime Anderson, as soon as the
paper ceased moving, went on writing.</p>
<p>Mr. Emberg quickly edited the copy, and gave
it to one of the messenger boys, who ran with it
to the pneumatic tube that sent it to the composing
room. There men who operated the typesetting
machines stood ready to set up the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>The reporter who had been detailed to call up
the hospitals was soon in communication with
them. He learned of the condition of the men
as soon as the doctors had made an examination.
One man died as he was being carried in. These
facts were rapidly told to Anderson, who wove
them into his story. When part of the account
had been written, and sent to the composing room
Mr. Emberg began making a heading for the
story.</p>
<p>It was to be a &ldquo;horse head,&rdquo; with plenty of
black type, and covering a good section of the
page. When part of this was written it was sent
upstairs, and the editor continued to write out the
remainder. Thus not a second was lost.</p>
<p>In less than three-quarters of an hour from the
time the explosion happened, the <i>Leader</i> was out
on the street with a very good account of the accident.
In fact, before the firemen had come
away, having brought up from the tank the last
body, newsboys were selling copies of the paper
containing the story of the terrible happening,
about the scene. It was good and quick work.</p>
<p>By this time the photographer sent to make a
view of the wrecked tank had returned to the office,
having made several exposures. In the darkroom
the plates were developed. Prints were
made. Then they were re-photographed; the
other plates were put through a process, and the
thin film that contains the image was removed
from the glass, and put on a zinc plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Acids were poured over this, and by the use of
certain chemicals the image on the film was transferred
to the zinc plate. This was quickly made
ready, and mounted on a lead block.</p>
<p>It was now almost time for the last edition.
The story of the accident had been made much
longer, for Larry, Mr. Newton, Smith, and Robinson
were sending in new details. They were
quickly set up, and the type was placed in the
forms. The picture was also put into the place it
was to occupy on the front page.</p>
<p>Then the form was covered with wet <i>papier-mach&eacute;</i>,
which was pressed into the type while
soft, and baked on by means of steam, under a
heavy weight. When the &ldquo;matrix,&rdquo; as it is
called, being a piece of cardboard with an exact
reproduction of every letter in the type, or every
line in the picture, was ready, it was rushed to
the stereotyping department. There a lead plate,
curved in a half-circle, was made from it, and this
plate, with a dozen others, each one representing
a page of the <i>Leader</i>, was clamped onto the
presses.</p>
<p>The machinery was adjusted, and the press
started, the papers being printed at the rate of
many thousands an hour. Thus the last edition
came out, about two hours after the accident,
with a picture of the scene, and the exploded
tank. It was up-to-date newspaper work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ve done about all we can
to-day,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton, addressing his
helpers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve covered everything I can think
of. I guess we beat some of the other papers.
Haven&rsquo;t seen any of them around here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was a bad accident,&rdquo; remarked
Larry, who had never before seen such a terrible
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t so much,&rdquo; spoke Smith. &ldquo;You
should have seen the one over on the Jersey
meadows, when nineteen were killed by the train
in the fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; replied Robinson. &ldquo;That was
something of an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see any worse than this,&rdquo;
said Larry. &ldquo;This will last me for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go back now?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; responded Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Tell
you what you might do, Larry: get an interview
with the head of the gas company. We can
work it in to-morrow. Ask him how he accounts
for the accident, have him explain how the gas
could leak into the tank, and how a spark could
be struck. It will be a good feature, if you can
get him to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, while the others went back to the <i>Leader</i>
office, Larry prepared to get an interview with
the president of the gas concern. He inquired of
the superintendent of the place, and found that
the man he wanted to see was a Mr. Reynolds.
Learning where his office was located, Larry went
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>When he told the messenger who was stationed
in the president&rsquo;s anteroom that he was from the
<i>Leader</i>, the messenger grinned, as much as to remark
that the president would not see reporters.
But the lad came back with the information that
Larry would be given a short interview. He was
ushered into the president&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>As soon as he caught a glimpse of him Larry
wondered where he had seen Mr. Reynolds before.
Then it came back to him. This was the
gentleman who had lost the valuable jewels
which Larry had found hidden in the vacant lot
one night. Mr. Reynolds, who was a rich banker,
as well as head of the gas company, had paid
Larry one thousand dollars reward for recovering
the gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to remember him,&rdquo; thought Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Reynolds, in gruff tones, quite different, Larry
thought, from the manner he had used in thanking
him for the recovery of the jewels.</p>
<p>The young reporter asked the questions Mr.
Newton had suggested, and was given answers
that explained how the explosion occurred. Mr.
Reynolds claimed that it was no fault of the gas
concern, and stated that the families of the victims
would be provided for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a terrible occurrence,&rdquo; said Mr. Reynolds,
&ldquo;and we regret it as much as anyone. We
try to take every safeguard for our employees,
but accidents will happen, sometimes, in spite of
all our care.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Larry asked a few more questions, and was
about to take his leave, when Mr. Reynolds, who
had been looking at him rather sharply, inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have I seen you before, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought back your jewels,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes! So you did! I have been wondering
where I saw you. Well, you didn&rsquo;t find
any more of my diamonds, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get them all
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Reynolds. &ldquo;I
was only joking. Though, to be exact, we did
not get all of them back. The thieves kept a
valuable heirloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a ring,&rdquo; replied Mr. Reynolds, &ldquo;in the
shape of a snake, coiled around three times. For
eyes it had two rubies, and in the end of the tail
was a diamond. It was not very costly, but I
valued it for its associations. It had been in our
family for over two hundred years, and I would
like very much to have kept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t in the box that I dug up?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trace of it, though it was taken with the
other things the thieves carried off. By the way,
they never found those thieves, did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose one of them took a fancy to my
ring, and wore it himself, instead of hiding it
with the rest of the booty,&rdquo; mused Mr. Reynolds.
&ldquo;Well, if you ever should happen to come across
it, and you might, for you&rsquo;re a lucky lad, I&rsquo;ll pay
you five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to find it for you without the reward,&rdquo;
Larry said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s little
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I guess,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Reynolds.
&ldquo;Now is there anything more you&rsquo;d like to know
about this terrible explosion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I have everything I need,&rdquo; answered
the young reporter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; responded Mr. Reynolds. &ldquo;I find
it pays better to be perfectly frank with the newspapers.
They&rsquo;ll find things out, anyhow, and you
might as well tell them first, and get it in right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry went back to the office, where he wrote
up his interview with Mr. Reynolds, in readiness
for the next day&rsquo;s paper. Then he went home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Jimmy&rsquo;s been kidnapped,&rdquo; thought
the boy, as he neared his house. In the excitement
over the explosion he had forgotten, for a
while, the threats the gang had made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MYSTERIOUS NOTES</span></h2>
<p>Larry was quite relieved when he got to the
house, and found that nothing unusual had occurred.
He was tired from the day&rsquo;s work, and
his mind was full of the terrible scenes he had
witnessed. Soon after supper he went to bed.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s room opened out on a fire-escape. As
it was warm he had his window open, though it
made the room more noisy. Several times during
the night he thought he heard someone moving
on the escape near his room, but he was too
sleepy to get up and make an investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s burglars they&rsquo;ll not get much here,&rdquo; he
thought, as he turned over, and went to sleep
again.</p>
<p>Larry awoke with a strange feeling that something
had happened. It was as if he had dreamed
a nightmare, the thoughts of which still lingered
with him. At first he thought it might be
a foreboding that Jimmy had been captured by
the gang during the night. He jumped out of
bed, but, as he did so, he heard his brother&rsquo;s
voice in the next room and knew that the little
chap was safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; thought Larry to himself,
as he began to dress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking too much
about this. I&rsquo;m getting to be as nervous and
fidgety as a girl. I must go to work, and forget
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked over to the bureau for his collar.
As he picked it up his attention was attracted by a
piece of paper pinned to the bureau cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
putting that there. I wonder if I&rsquo;m beginning
to walk in my sleep, and write notes to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unpinned the paper. It was folded several
times, and when Larry had opened it, he saw
printed in large letters this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>FOUR DAYS MORE. <span class="hst">BLUE HAND.</span></i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Larry did not disguise from himself the fact
that he was frightened. That the gang had not
given up the matter, but was acting along the
lines the members had laid down, seemed certain.
It showed also that they were keeping
close watch of the time, and of Larry&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been what the noises were I
heard out on the roof,&rdquo; Larry mused, as he finished
dressing. &ldquo;They are certainly a bold band
to come into my room at night, and pin this here.
They ran the risk of being taken for burglars,
and, though I haven&rsquo;t a revolver to shoot, someone
who saw them on the fire-escape might put a
bullet into them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>That he was being watched by a desperate
gang, who had possession of his deed, and who
would go to almost any length to accomplish their
purpose, Larry had no doubt. He felt more than
ever the necessity of guarding his little brother,
yet he did not know how to do it.</p>
<p>To speak to his mother, Larry felt, would
only cause her so much alarm that it might make
her ill, as her health was not very good. As for
Jimmy he was too small to appreciate his danger,
even if he had been told. The only thing to do
was to make him believe in the danger of automobiles,
and have him keep close to the house.</p>
<p>Yet even that might count for little, seeing that
the members of the gang had shown that they did
not fear to enter the house, giving no warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what I&rsquo;d better do?&rdquo; thought Larry,
conscious of the feeling that it was no easy task
to be a lad pitted against a powerful band of men
bent on doing him injury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost willing
to sign the deed, and let them have the property
for the money they&rsquo;ll give. Of course, it is nothing
like what I believe it to be worth, but it would
save a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So convinced, at first, was he that this would
be the best plan, that, before he finished dressing,
he sat down, and began to write out an advertisement
to &ldquo;Blue Hand,&rdquo; that he could put in the
paper to give notice the deed would be signed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll not do it!&rdquo; decided Larry, suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll see if they&rsquo;ll dare to do as
they say. I&rsquo;m at a disadvantage, but I&rsquo;ll do my
best to get ahead of those fellows. I&rsquo;ll not give
in until they do something worse than leave notes
in my room, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, feeling better, now that he had made up
his mind to fight, Larry finished dressing, and
went to breakfast, as if getting mysterious notes
during the night was not unusual.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s first assignment when he reached the
office was to get an account of a wedding that had
occurred the night before. There are two assignments
reporters hate to cover, weddings and
obituaries, and Larry, in his brief experience,
had come to feel much as did all other members
of his profession about these things. But, just as
a reporter never shrinks from danger in getting
a story for his paper (if he is a real reporter, and
not a pretended one), so none of them ever &ldquo;kick,&rdquo;
at least to their city editor, when they get a disagreeable
assignment.</p>
<p>Larry started off to get the wedding, which
was that of persons fairly well known, or else the
<i>Leader</i> never would have sent for it. Usually
some of the women reporters on the paper attended
to these society affairs, but at that time
one of the women was away on vacation, and the
other had double work to do, so the men had to
help out, and much grumbling there was in consequence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what people want to get married
for,&rdquo; thought Larry, as he walked along the
street where the house of the bride was located.
&ldquo;At least if they do, I don&rsquo;t see why they want
it in the papers. I&rsquo;d rather cover an Anarchist
meeting, than go where a lot of women will tell
how the bride looked, and what she wore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus talking to himself, Larry walked along,
forgetting in his sense of injury to take note of
the numbers of the houses. Suddenly his feet
slid out from under him, and he went down on the
sidewalk rather hard.</p>
<p>He had stepped into a lot of rice that covered
the flags for quite a distance, the small kernels
making the stones very slippery. Larry picked
himself up, and looked about to see if his undignified
arrival in a sitting position had been observed
by anyone. The street seemed deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this is where the wedding was,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;This is some of the rice they threw at
the bride for good luck. It was bad luck for me,
though. Well, here goes,&rdquo; and with that Larry
walked up the steps, which were white with kernels,
and rang the bell.</p>
<p>To the girl who opened the door Larry stated
his errand; that he had come to get an account of
the wedding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the servant, a good-natured-looking
Irish girl. &ldquo;Did you hurt yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you fell,&rdquo; and she began to laugh
at Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the reporter, blushing at the remembrance
of his fall, &ldquo;no, I guess not. Did you
see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at the window,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, you went down so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t get a letter or a telegram to
say it was about to happen, that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; admitted
Larry, joining in the girl&rsquo;s merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the maid; &ldquo;none of the family
is up yet, but I guess Miss Clarice will soon be
down, and she&rsquo;ll give you all the particulars. It
was a sweet wedding, to be sure, and the bride
looked lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; grunted Larry, beneath his breath. He
was not particularly fond of lovely brides. He
was shown into a large parlor, back of which
was a drawing-room, and both apartments bore
evidences of the previous night&rsquo;s gayeties. Flowers
were strewn about the floor, and there was
rice over everything, while a number of old shoes
were in one corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t cleaned up yet,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;It
was three o&rsquo;clock when we got to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left Larry sitting alone in the darkened
parlor, while she went about her duties. Larry
sat there for half an hour. Then he began to get
nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they&rsquo;ve forgotten all about me,&rdquo;
thought the young reporter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something
else to do besides sitting here waiting for someone
to come, and tell me about a wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>He gave a loud cough, to attract the attention
of anyone who might be within hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how you frightened me!&rdquo; exclaimed a
voice, and a tall, dark, and exceedingly pretty
girl came into the room. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone
was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the <i>Leader</i>,&rdquo; said Larry, rising. &ldquo;I
came about the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you a real, truly reporter?&rdquo; asked the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I can say I am,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see a real reporter,&rdquo;
the girl went on. &ldquo;It must be a grand
life. Think of seeing terrible fires, and big accidents,
and writing about murders, and suicides,
and battles, and sudden death, and&mdash;and all sorts
of horrible, scary things! Oh, I would love to
be a reporter, only papa will not hear of it. Did
you ever see a drowned man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several,&rdquo; replied Larry, wondering what kind
of a girl this was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely! And did you ever see a real,
live, truly, really murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have seen men in the Tombs, accused
of murder, though they had not been convicted
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how perfectly fascinating! I must get
papa to let me be a reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this wedding,&rdquo; began Larry. &ldquo;Could
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about weddings,&rdquo; interrupted
the girl. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re horrid, stupid things.
Tell me something about what you report. And
to think I&rsquo;ve seen a real reporter, just as I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry agreed with her statement about weddings
being stupid affairs, but he felt he was sent
to get an account of one, and not to talk about
himself. He was a little uncertain how to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ever at a fire?&rdquo; the girl went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several times,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;What is the
bride&rsquo;s name, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the walls fall and crush anyone?&rdquo; asked
Larry&rsquo;s questioner, paying no attention to what
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Can you tell me the groom&rsquo;s
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ever in an explosion, Mr. Reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, close to one, once. Now about this
wedding. I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me how you write stories,&rdquo; the girl
went on. &ldquo;I think it must be perfectly lovely to
write things for the paper? Do you think I
could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; replied Larry, in desperation. He
did not know what to do, and did not wish to
offend the girl, who was very pretty, and seemed
much in earnest in her questions. But help came
from an unexpected quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Clarice!&rdquo; exclaimed a woman&rsquo;s voice,
as she came into the room. &ldquo;I have been looking
everywhere for you. What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am giving the reporter from the <i>Leader</i> an
account of the wedding,&rdquo; replied Clarice, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far have you gone with it?&rdquo; asked her
mother. &ldquo;If you do as you usually do, you have
asked more questions than you have answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only asking about a reporter&rsquo;s life,&rdquo;
spoke the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly lovely. They see
murdered people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice, you must not talk so!&rdquo; exclaimed her
mother. &ldquo;Now, you run upstairs, and I&rsquo;ll tell the
young man about the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pouting a little the girl went out, nodding and
smiling at Larry. The bride&rsquo;s mother then gave
the young reporter a story of the ceremony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CIRCUS</span></h2>
<p>Larry got along all right as far as taking the
name of the bride, that of the groom, the officiating
minister, and the attendants at the wedding
ceremony was concerned. But when he came to
take notes of the kinds of material in the dresses
and the styles, he found himself helplessly at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bride&rsquo;s dress was cut <i>en traine</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Loftus, the mother of the young woman who had
been married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch that about her dress being cut
by a train,&rdquo; said Larry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Loftus laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor boy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
shame to send you after a wedding. They ought
to have a woman to describe the dresses. I don&rsquo;t
wonder things get in the paper wrong. Who
could expect a man to tell about a woman&rsquo;s
dress? But I&rsquo;ll explain it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she kindly initiated Larry into the mysteries
of the feminine styles. She told him <i>en
traine</i> meant that the dress had what old-fashioned
persons called a &ldquo;long trail,&rdquo; which swept
on the ground. She also told him how to spell
such words as &ldquo;mousselaine,&rdquo; &ldquo;peau de soie,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cr&ecirc;pe de Chine,&rdquo; and other terms that described
the different materials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>With her help Larry did not make out so badly
as he feared he would at first, but he was glad
when he had all the facts, and could go back to
the office to write them up. On his way out he
saw Clarice peering over the balustrade at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Reporter!&rdquo; she called, with a merry
laugh, and Larry, though not knowing exactly
what to make of her questions, thought she was
one of the nicest girls he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He managed to turn out an account of the wedding,
though it was not a very good one in his
estimation. But Mr. Emberg did not seem to
be very particular about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry through with that, Larry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
have something else for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Larry finished by telling how the bridal
couple had gone on a trip South, and turned his
copy in at the city desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up now,&rdquo; he said, that being the reporter&rsquo;s
expressive way of notifying the city editor or his
assistant that he is ready for another assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to go up to Madison Square Garden,&rdquo;
said Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;The circus has come
to town, and I want a good descriptive story of
how the animals got in, what the men are doing
in the way of getting the Garden into shape, something
about the freaks, and whatever else you see
of interest. Make it a sort of special yarn, and
do your best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>That was an assignment any reporter would
have been pleased to get, for though some of the
older men had done it for years, and there remained
little or nothing that was new in it, still
the spirit of the boy seemed to linger in them,
and there were always plenty who were eager for
the chance to &ldquo;write up&rdquo; the circus.</p>
<p>Larry appreciated his chance, and determined
to do his best. He soon arrived at the Garden,
and found the place in great confusion. Hundreds
of men were scattered about the huge place.
Some were erecting the tiers of seats, others were
constructing the rings or stages on which the
performers would appear; while high in the air,
near the roof of the immense amphitheater, men,
looking like spiders, were in a web of ropes, adjusting
the trapezes.</p>
<p>In one corner was a group of tumblers and
acrobats going through their &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo; to keep in
practice, for the show was to open in two days.
On some of the trapezes the men and women were
swinging about, and in one section of the Garden
a troupe of Japanese contortionists and balancers
were doing seemingly impossible feats.</p>
<p>As Larry watched he saw a man in pink tights
come out of a dressing-room, followed by several
of the circus helpers. The performer went to
where a trapeze swung high in the air. From
the cross-bar there dangled a rope, which the man
in tights grasped. Larry was near enough to
overhear what was being said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give &rsquo;em something new,&rdquo; he remarked
to a man with a long whip, who seemed
to be a ringmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the man with the whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me, and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the one in pink tights went up the rope
hand over hand, with an ease that seemed surprising
to Larry, who had often tried the thing
at Campton, in his father&rsquo;s barn, when, with
other country boys, he had played circus.</p>
<p>Reaching the trapeze, the man sat down on the
bar, and began to swing to and fro. He seemed
to be adjusting the ropes. Then he turned over
backward, and swung by his knees, head downward.
Working his body back and forth he
caused the trapeze to sway rapidly to and fro, in
a long swing.</p>
<p>For several minutes this went on, until the
trapeze was moving backward and forward, with
its human burden, as far as possible.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man in pink tights gave a loud
cry just as he reached the highest point in a backward
swing. Then, to Larry&rsquo;s horror, and seemingly
no less to the astonishment of the ringmaster
and the helpers, the man was seen shooting
downward, as if the ropes of the trapeze had
broken. Larry was sure the man would be killed.</p>
<p>But, just when it seemed that the man&rsquo;s head
would strike the ground, and he be terribly injured,
the ropes suddenly became taut, and
the performer&rsquo;s downward course was checked,
though he continued to swing back and forth in
large arcs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>All at once he straightened up, and lightly
leaped from the cross-bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that for a hair-raiser?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that make &rsquo;em sit up and take
notice some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure will,&rdquo; replied the ringmaster. &ldquo;I
thought you were a goner. How did you manage
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the ropes on both sides shortened by a
series of slip-knots,&rdquo; the man in pink tights explained.
&ldquo;Then, when I was swinging good and
hard, I yanked the cord that held the first two
knots in place. The weight of my body pulled
the others out, and the rope began to lengthen,
and you saw me come down. I had it calculated
so that I would cease falling a little ways from
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good trick,&rdquo; commented the ringmaster.</p>
<p>Larry thought so, too, and wondered how men
cared to risk their lives in such dangerous performances.
If the rope should break when the
man&rsquo;s descent was so suddenly checked, he would
surely be killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Larry saw about all there was going on among
the performers, and decided next to visit the animal
quarters. There he found a very lively place
indeed. Some of the cages of wild beasts had
just arrived from the train on which the circus
came to New York, having been out on the road.
The big wagons, containing lions, tigers, leopards,
hyenas, giraffes, hippopotami, snakes, monkeys,
bears, and other denizens of the forest,
plain, or desert were rolled into place, either by
horses pulling them, or by the elephants pushing
them.</p>
<p>Larry was quite surprised to see how these
huge and seemingly unwieldy and clumsy creatures
were made to perform hard work. They
were useful as well as being ornamental, from a
showman&rsquo;s standpoint. Putting their big heads
against a wagon or truck that would take the
strength of eight horses, one elephant would
shove it into place with ease, two men at the
tongue directing its course.</p>
<p>Larry found the head animal man, who gave
the young reporter some facts to use in his story
for the paper, and related a few incidents of the
recent trip.</p>
<p>While the cage of lions was being put into
place there came from it a terrifying roar. It
seemed to shake the very ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Nero isn&rsquo;t feeling in the best of spirits,&rdquo;
said the animal trainer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a bad tooth
that pains him, and he&rsquo;s as ugly as they come. I
hope nothing happens. If he got out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The
showman shrugged his shoulders in a way that
told more than words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, there!&rdquo; he cried, suddenly, to the
men who were guiding the pole of the cage containing
Nero. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll run into that post if you
don&rsquo;t look out. There you go! Call to that elephant
to stop pushing, somebody!&rdquo; yelled the
trainer, for a huge elephant was shoving the lion&rsquo;s
cage into place.</p>
<p>The men at the guiding pole had slipped, and
the cage was headed straight for a big iron
pillar.</p>
<p>The next instant there was a crash of splintering
wood, and the cage ran full tilt into the column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookout, everybody!&rdquo; the trainer cried.
&ldquo;Nero&rsquo;s cage is open! Get the hot irons ready,
in case he&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant ceased pushing now, and backed
up a few paces. From the cage came a roar
more terrible than any that had preceded it, and,
as if awakened by a call to battle, all the other
wild beasts began to utter their cries, so that the
Garden sounded like a section of a South African
jungle.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tawny yellow streak shot out of
the lion&rsquo;s cage, launched itself through the air,
and landed on the elephant&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nero&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; yelled the trainer. &ldquo;Lay low,
everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roars of the maddened beast had turned to
angry growls. It crouched low on the back of
the huge elephant, sinking its claws into the
brute&rsquo;s hide. The pachyderm trumpeted loudly
in pain and terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>A group of trainers and helpers huddled together
in a space made by several cages. The men
were afraid to run, for fear of attracting the attention
of the lion to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried the head trainer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the
hot irons! If he comes this way fire this revolver
at him. It&rsquo;s only got blanks in it, but it may scare
him back to his cage. Only the door is broken.
If we get him in we can scare him into remaining
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then throwing a big revolver down on the
sawdust, the trainer ran to where the irons were
heating. At that instant the lion leaped from the
elephant&rsquo;s back, and came straight at the men.
Not one stayed to see what would happen next,
but fled in a hurry. Nor did anyone pick up the
revolver.</p>
<p>Larry, who had been standing near the head
trainer, saw the lion coming. His first thought
was to flee, but he hardly knew which way to
turn, as he had never been in the Garden before,
and did not know where safety was. Then,
hardly knowing what he was doing, Larry leaped
forward, and grabbed the revolver. The lion
was not twenty feet away, and was trotting
straight at him, growling menacingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire at him! Fire at him!&rdquo; cried the head
trainer, who was at the far side of the quarters.
He had grabbed two hot irons from the furnace,
where they were kept in readiness for just such
emergencies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>The lion, seeing the boy standing in front of
him, crouched for a spring. Larry&rsquo;s heart was
beating like a triphammer, and his hand trembled
so he could hardly hold the revolver.</p>
<p>Then, like a streak of sunshine, the beast leaped
for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAST WARNING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry fired the revolver. It was an automatic
one, and all he had to do was to pull the trigger.
Right at the face of the lion he aimed it, as the
animal was in the air above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack! Crack! Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Streaks of fire from the heavy cartridges shot
in the direction of the beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last shot. As he fired it Larry
leaped to one side to escape the lion&rsquo;s claws. Then
he cast the revolver at the beast, and fled.</p>
<p>But there was no need of this. Cowed by the
streaks of flame, and the noise of the reports, the
brute, who had been only slightly wounded, had
no sooner landed on the sawdust, than, with tail
between its legs, it started back toward the cage it
had left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chase after him, some of you fellows!&rdquo;
shouted the head trainer. &ldquo;His nerve&rsquo;s gone now.
That boy has more sense and grit than the whole
lot of you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Now that the danger was practically over, the
attendants ran back, and toward the lion&rsquo;s wagon.
The brute, though still growling and roaring, had
leaped into its broken cage, where it stood crouching
in one corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, now; wheel another cage up in front
of the broken one!&rdquo; the trainer exclaimed. &ldquo;That
will hold him until we can fix his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was soon done, and all further danger
was past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you,&rdquo; the trainer said,
coming up to Larry, having taken the hot irons
back. &ldquo;It was a nervy bit of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess if I&rsquo;d stopped to think I&rsquo;d never have
done it,&rdquo; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my lad, and it was well done,
just the same. If Nero had gotten loose, the way
he&rsquo;s feeling now, and once got the taste of human
blood, there&rsquo;s no telling what might have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trainer drew a pad from his pocket, and
wrote a few lines on it, handing the paper to
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pass for you and any friend you want
to bring along, to come and see the show,&rdquo; the
trainer replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for two box seats at
any performance, and as often as you like to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d better take it,&rdquo; said Larry.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t stop the lion for pay, and besides the
office might not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry you,&rdquo; responded the
trainer. &ldquo;I know what you mean; you don&rsquo;t
want to &lsquo;graft&rsquo; the way a lot of fellows do who
think they&rsquo;re newspaper men. But that is all
right. A real newspaper man never grafts, but
this pass isn&rsquo;t graft. We always send the newspapers
lots of tickets, anyhow. It&rsquo;s part of our
advertising contract. This is simply an extra
one for yourself, as a sort of recognition for what
you did, though it doesn&rsquo;t begin to pay for the
trouble you saved us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think it&rsquo;s all right I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; Larry
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. Come to the show, and see
Nero go through his paces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men by this time had come up to repair the
broken cage, and with a nod of farewell, the
trainer left Larry, as there were many things to
attend to toward getting the circus into shape.
Larry wandered about the big Garden, seeing odd
little incidents that he made use of in his newspaper
story.</p>
<p>He found the manager in charge of the freaks,
and introducing himself, Larry started to ask if
there was anything new that might make a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, here is a little item you might work
in,&rdquo; replied the manager, looking at Larry in
what the reporter thought was a strange sort of
way. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a romance on our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A romance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see the living skeleton has gone and
fallen in love with the fat woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Larry, thinking the manager
might be trying to &ldquo;string&rdquo; him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Come out and have a talk with
him. But that isn&rsquo;t the worst. You see, the fat
lady is smitten with the India rubber man, and
the bearded lady has gone and fallen in love with
the living skeleton, so you see, things are all
mixed up. Come out into the freak room, and
see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering whether to believe the story or not,
Larry followed the manager. He found the
freaks all sitting in one corner of the Garden, on
a sort of raised platform. Sure enough the living
skeleton was gazing with a sort of lorn expression
at the fat lady, who, in turn, was making
eyes at the India rubber gentleman, who was practicing
stretching his neck until the skin of it almost
touched his forehead. The bearded lady,
who was combing her whiskers every now and
then, glanced in the direction of the living skeleton,
who was shivering, though the day was
warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself,&rdquo; spoke the manager,
in a whisper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make fun of &rsquo;em, if you
write it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; replied Larry, thinking he
had found something that would fit in the circus
story very well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Having about all the material he needed, and
seeing that the hour was getting late, Larry decided
to go back to the office. He found himself
in quite a crowd of men and boys who were hanging
around the entrance to the Garden, as he
came out. He thought he felt a hand in the side
pocket of his coat, as he worked his way through
the throng, but, as he knew he had nothing of
value in it, he decided, even if it was a pickpocket,
he would not stop then to try to capture him.
So he pressed on. He was just in time to catch
a car for the office, and gave the incident no further
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you get a good story?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Emberg, as Larry entered the city room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good; one of the lions got loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them work any press-agent yarns off
on you,&rdquo; cautioned the city editor, with a smile,
for he was used to such stories from circuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is true,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I saw it myself.
In fact, I fired a revolver at Nero to drive
him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Nero who was loose?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Newton, overhearing what Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they called him. He seemed
ugly enough to be Nero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s no fake, if you saw Nero loose,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Newton. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the worst lion in captivity.
That ought to be a good story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world didn&rsquo;t you telephone it in?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;You might have been
beaten by some of the early editions of the yellows.
Hurry up, now, make that the feature of
your story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Somewhat chagrined over his failure to have
appreciated the real news value of the lion incident,
Larry began to turn out copy as fast as he
could write. Mr. Emberg read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing all right!&rdquo; he called to Larry.
&ldquo;It is as good a circus story as we&rsquo;ve had in a
long time. Keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry told of everything in connection with
the escape of Nero, and then began to describe
the different scenes, including the way the Garden
was being made ready for the crowds. By this
time the first edition had gone to press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time, now,&rdquo; said the city editor.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use the rest in the next edition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good story about the freaks,&rdquo; said
Larry, and he began to tell of the mixed-up romance.</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a burst of laughter, in
which several reporters and Mr. Emberg joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! I saw &rsquo;em myself,&rdquo; exclaimed
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Emberg.
&ldquo;It was gotten up for your benefit. The manager
sized you up for a new reporter, and thought
the old story might go with you, though he must
have known that no copy reader would have
passed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo; asked Larry, his faith in human
nature somewhat shaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the oldest press-agent&rsquo;s yarns that
ever did duty in a circus,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;If
there were any freaks in the Ark, and they had a
press agent, he told that story to the first reporter
who interviewed him when Captain Noah&rsquo;s boat
landed on Mount Ararat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Larry learned two things that day. One
was that things old reporters think are fakes
sometimes turn out to be true, and the other was
that you can never believe a manager of the freak
department of a circus. Both lessons were useful
ones.</p>
<p>When he went out to lunch, Larry put his hand
into the side pocket of his coat. He felt an envelope
there, and thinking it was a letter which
his mother might have given him to mail, and
which he had forgotten, he pulled it out. He at
once saw that it was no ordinary letter, for the
envelope bore a large blue cross upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that come from,&rdquo; thought Larry.
He opened it. Inside was a small piece of paper,
on which was printed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>THREE DAYS MORE. <span class="hst">BLUE HAND.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That was what the tugging at my coat in
the crowd at the Garden meant,&rdquo; reasoned Larry.
&ldquo;Some one of the gang must have been close to
me. They must be following me around, and
keeping track of me wherever I go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>At first this thought alarmed him. It was unpleasant
to feel that someone was always looking
at you, knowing your every movement so
well that they could slip up, and drop notes into
your pocket. Larry felt his courage leaving him.
He half determined to agree to the gang&rsquo;s wishes.
Then, as he thought of what Mr. Newton had
said, he grew braver, and decided to fight to the
end.</p>
<p>That night, going home, Larry was in quite a
crowd on the elevated train. He tried to keep
watch, and see if anyone dropped anything into
his pockets, but the crowd was so dense that it
would have been an easy matter for a person to
approach him closely, and escape detection.</p>
<p>So Larry was not greatly surprised, when, on
reaching the street, he found another missive, in
the same language.</p>
<p>The same thing happened on two successive
nights. Try as he did he could discover no one,
however. He began to be quite nervous. A person
who could steal up on him in a crowd, unknown
to him, and drop letters into his pocket,
was clearly a dangerous customer, Larry reasoned.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, as he left the train, he felt
a suspicious tug at his coat pocket. He turned
quickly, and caught a glimpse of a youth hurrying
through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that wasn&rsquo;t Peter Manton I&rsquo;ll eat my hat,&rdquo;
thought Larry.</p>
<p>He drew out the letter, which, in accordance
with his expectations, he found. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>THIS IS THE LAST WARNING.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LARRY&rsquo;S NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Somehow, instead of being frightened at receiving
the ominous message thrust into his
pocket in that mysterious manner, Larry felt a
sense of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re at the end of this warning
business,&rdquo; he remarked to himself. &ldquo;It was
getting annoying. I&rsquo;d rather do some real fighting,
than all this sparring in the dark. If they&rsquo;re
going to do something let &rsquo;em do it, and not be
hinting at it all the time. The suspense is worse
than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Larry hurried toward his home he could
not help feeling a little bit worried lest something
had befallen Jimmy. The message seemed
to indicate that the patience of the gang was exhausted,
and that they would now proceed to act.</p>
<p>Consequently Larry felt much relieved when
he reached home, and found his brother and all
the others safe. He was tired with his day&rsquo;s
work, and went to bed early.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>As next day was Sunday Larry decided he
would take Jimmy for a trip to Central Park, to
see the animals, and find some shady nook where
he could take a rest, and make believe he was back
in the country again.</p>
<p>Larry thought that it might also serve a good
purpose in foiling any ideas the gang might have
of kidnapping Jimmy on that day. On Sundays
the children generally went for a walk alone, and
Larry was afraid that if they did so on this occasion,
advantage might be taken of the chance.</p>
<p>After breakfast Larry proposed the trip to
Mary and Jimmy. Mrs. Dexter agreed to it, saying
that if Larry would look after the younger
children she and Lucy would go and visit a friend
in Jersey City. Preparations for the trip were
soon made, and Larry, with his brother and sister,
started off, Mrs. Dexter and Lucy taking an
opposite direction.</p>
<p>It was very fine in the park. The birds were
singing in the trees, the sky was blue, and the
grass was almost as nice as in the meadow in
Campton, Larry thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jest like the country!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy,
running, and turning a somersault on the turf,
while Mary gave chase to a gray squirrel that
seemed quite tame, and frisked about on the low
branches of a tree.</p>
<p>With the children Larry wandered about in
various shady places, now and then sitting down
to rest. There was a large crowd in the park,
for the day was warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see the elephants an&rsquo; tigers,&rdquo;
suggested Mary, her eyes growing big with wonderment
in anticipation of the delights of viewing
the wild animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Larry, who, though he
would not admit it, had a keen desire himself to
see the beasts.</p>
<p>They amused themselves by throwing peanuts
to the elephant, and Jimmy insisted on giving a
share of his to the hippopotamus. The nuts were
so small, and the animal&rsquo;s mouth so large, that
it is doubtful if he even tasted them.</p>
<p>It was while standing watching the elephants
that Larry became conscious that someone was
observing him and the children rather closely. A
little behind him, as he turned, he could see a
short, stout man, who seemed to be much interested
in the pachyderms.</p>
<p>Larry was sure this man had been staring at
him, but, try as he did, the young reporter could
not remember where he had seen him before.
As he turned back to look once more at the
elephants, Larry noticed that the man&rsquo;s eyes were
turned toward Jimmy, who, in a new suit, was
an attractive-looking little chap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s a kidnapper?&rdquo; mused Larry,
half inclined to laugh at his foolish fancies. &ldquo;I
must keep watch, and see if he follows us when
we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Larry gradually drew the children away from
the elephant inclosure, and over to where the
monkeys were housed. The reporter watched,
but, though he was sure the man looked after
them, and noted where they went, he did not
leave the spot where he was.</p>
<p>Mary and Jimmy found much to amuse them
in the house of the primates. The funny antics
of the monkeys kept the crowd in roars of laughter.
Even Larry forgot about keeping his eye
on Jimmy, and watched the odd contortions of the
queer, half-human-looking beasts.</p>
<p>Once again, however, he became aware of that
strange feeling of being under observation.
Looking around, he saw the same man behind
them. Larry had no doubt now but that the
fellow was following them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he thinks that he&rsquo;s going to kidnap
Jimmy right from under my nose, he&rsquo;ll find he&rsquo;s
barking up the wrong tree!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry,
as he put his arm around his brother. &ldquo;All the
same, I guess we&rsquo;d better get out of here. Some
others of the blue-handed man&rsquo;s gang may be
on the lookout for us, and I don&rsquo;t care to have a
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked about the park a little while
longer, and then, as they were getting hungry,
decided to start for home. When they boarded a
car Larry looked all about to see if he had been
followed. There was quite a throng of people,
and the reporter, though he was not quite sure,
thought he saw the man who had stood near him
in the elephants&rsquo; inclosure, and also in the monkey
house. The man, if he was the same one,
was accompanied by a boy about Larry&rsquo;s age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure that lad was Peter Manton,&rdquo;
thought Larry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something underhanded
about this whole thing. I wish I could find out
what it is, and break up the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry, with the children, reached home before
Mrs. Dexter and Lucy returned. As Mary and
Jimmy were hungry, Larry began foraging in the
cupboard to find something to give the youngsters.</p>
<p>As he took the cover off a dish in the pantry,
to see what the receptacle contained, Larry saw
a paper in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t look good to eat,&rdquo; he remarked,
as he unfolded it. He gave a start, as he saw a
big blue cross on it, while, in bold characters,
was printed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>DO NOT THINK WE HAVE FORGOTTEN.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been here since we went away this
morning,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;They entered the
rooms, and left this note. They must be keeping
a close watch on the house, to know when we
all go out, or else they would not venture to come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Larry called on Mr. Newton. He
told the reporter all about the Sunday adventures,
including that part about the man, and the finding
of the note.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your courage,&rdquo; advised Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;It begins to look now as if they were only
bluffing. Maybe it was all a bluff. Still, don&rsquo;t
be too careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing we can do?&rdquo; asked
Larry, on whom the strain was beginning to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather encouraged by the sensible view Mr.
Newton took of it, Larry went home, and slept
soundly&mdash;so soundly, in fact, that he did not get
up in time, and was a little late at the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an assignment for you, Larry,&rdquo; called
Mr. Emberg. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pulling down a big brick
chimney at the old electric light power-station
to-day. Going to loosen the base by dynamite,
I understand. I want you to get a good story of
it. I&rsquo;ll send a photographer with you to get a
picture of it as it topples over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry was soon on his way to the scene of the
demolition, accompanied by the photographer.
The chimney was a very tall one, and was considered
unsafe, as part of the power-house had
been destroyed by fire some time before.</p>
<p>Quite a crowd of persons were on hand to witness
the operations, as word of what was intended
had spread through the neighborhood.
There were also several other reporters there, and
one or two photographers. Larry found the foreman
in charge of the work, and asked him to explain
the plan, so as to get a good understanding
of it when he should write the story. The foreman
went into details about putting a small
charge of dynamite under one corner of the stack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;The force of dynamite is mainly downward,&rdquo;
he stated. &ldquo;But we think there will be enough
upward power to the blast to gently tilt the chimney
over to the east, where it will fall without
doing any damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if it falls the other way, and crashes
down on top of those low buildings?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have it guyed up with ropes to prevent
that,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preliminary work was almost finished,
when a man, carrying a red flag, came out of a
small shanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the dynamite,&rdquo; said Larry, to the
picture man. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll see some fun, I am
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman made everyone move back out of
harm&rsquo;s way. Most persons were glad enough to
obey the request, but the reporters, including
Larry, said if they had to stay so far back they
could see nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the risk you run,&rdquo; objected the
foreman. &ldquo;Some of you may be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the chance,&rdquo; replied several. &ldquo;We
want to be close by when the stack hits the
ground, and so do the photographers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman interposed no more objections,
but ordered the work to go on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The reporters were gathered in a little group,
and after talking matters over decided to move
toward a small tool shanty, that stood well to the
left of the stack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no danger then,&rdquo; agreed Larry.</p>
<p>So the scribes went to the hut. The man
with the red flag had placed the explosive at the
bottom of the stack, and, seeing that everything
was in readiness, waved his flag at a signal that
he was about to touch off the fuse. At this sign
of danger the crowd pressed farther back.</p>
<p>A thin spiral of smoke arose from the fuse.
The man with the red flag ran off at top speed.
From a window of the shanty the whole affair
could be seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a dull, rumbling sound,
and the earth shook. Then a little cloud of bricks,
mortar, and dust shot upward. Next the tall
stack, the foundation of which had been weakened,
began slowly to tilt over. As the foreman
had desired, it was falling to the left.</p>
<p>Then all at once the stack seemed to hesitate.
It appeared to be poised, like the Leaning Tower
of Pisa. Next, as though the direction had been
changed by a giant&rsquo;s hand, the chimney began
falling toward the shanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those reporters will all be killed!&rdquo; cried the
foreman. &ldquo;I warned them of the danger. Come
out of that!&rdquo; he yelled, as if they had a chance to
obey. Swiftly the tower was coming nearer the
earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Then, as suddenly as before, the direction of
the fall was changed. The chimney, that had
been seemingly in one solid piece, broke in the
center.</p>
<p>Down on top of the shack crashed the bricks
and mortar. The corner of the shanty crumpled
up like paper, just after most of the reporters had
fled.</p>
<p>Larry, however, was not so fortunate. When
the crash came he was in the far corner of the
hut. The breaking and rending of timbers had
formed a sort of archway above his head, and
the blows from the bricks had been somewhat
warded off. Larry had a most narrow escape
from sudden death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on out!&rdquo; called the other reporters to
him, as the dust settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Larry, faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIMMY IS MISSED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, are you hurt?&rdquo; asked one
of the newspaper men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My foot is pinned down under a plank!&rdquo;
Larry exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m hurt much,
unless it&rsquo;s a sprained ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time several men engaged by the contractor
to help raze the big stack came running
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you out!&rdquo; the foreman cried.
&ldquo;Heave away, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laborers heaved away with right good
will, and soon had tossed aside the planks that
held Larry fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on out now!&rdquo; the foreman cried.</p>
<p>Larry endeavored to, but failed. He tried to
take a few steps, but sank back with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ankle&rsquo;s broken!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at it,&rdquo; the foreman said, with
rough sympathy in his tones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sort of doctor.
Have to be, with a lot of men getting hurt
all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Entering the ruined shack he picked Larry up
as easily as if the young reporter was a child, and
carried him outside. Then he looked at the right
foot, which was the one that pained the lad. The
ankle was swollen, and the shoelaces were
stretched tight across the instep. The foreman
whipped out his knife, and cut the strings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Larry, with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only sprained, not broken,&rdquo; the foreman
announced, after gently feeling of the injury.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be laid up a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I walk now; I mean in a little while?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want to lame yourself permanently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; the lad exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to send the story of this thing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you worry about the story,&rdquo; exclaimed
one of the other reporters. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look
out for you, all right. Stanley will telephone it
in for you, and tell how you got laid up. We&rsquo;re
not after a beat on this. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid Mr. Emberg will want to hear
from me,&rdquo; said Larry, who, if he had developed
any faults yet as a newspaper man, was blessed
with that of being too conscientious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you to the telephone station in my
rig,&rdquo; volunteered the foreman. &ldquo;I guess your
sprained ankle won&rsquo;t prevent you from talking,
provided you feel you have to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; answered Larry, glad of
the chance to send the story in himself, though he
was grateful for the aid of the other reporters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>There was nothing more to be obtained in the
way of a story, as the big stack was leveled,
though the task had not been as well performed
as had been hoped. So Larry was lifted into the
carriage, and driven to the nearest telephone.
There he explained matters to Mr. Emberg, who
had a reporter take the account over the wire, as
Larry explained all the details, including the
smashing of the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you go home, and doctor yourself up,&rdquo;
said Mr. Emberg, coming in on the wire when
Larry had finished his story. &ldquo;Mr. Newton or I
will be over to see you to-night. Take care of
yourself, and don&rsquo;t worry. Your job will be here
when you get ready to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This relieved Larry&rsquo;s mind for he was a little
uncertain as to what happened to reporters who
were not able to come to work. Then, again being
helped into the foreman&rsquo;s carriage, Larry was
driven to his home, and very much surprised Mrs.
Dexter and Lucy were to see him brought to the
house, unable to walk.</p>
<p>Matters were soon explained, however, and a
doctor was sent for. He said the sprain, while
a bad and painful one, was not likely to last
long, and promised Larry that, if he was careful,
he might be able to go out in a week or ten
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make it any sooner, doctor?&rdquo; asked
Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, my boy. That&rsquo;s a short enough
time to let the cords and sinews get into shape
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry made up his mind to bear it as best he
could, and, with Lucy&rsquo;s help, he hobbled to an
easy-chair, where he sat down, while his sister
made him comfortable with cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jimmy?&rdquo; asked Larry, suddenly, as
he happened to think that he had not seen his little
brother since coming home. His heart began
to beat, almost, in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Mary went up on the top floor to call
on a little girl who lives there,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Larry, in
such a peculiar tone that Mrs. Dexter was
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Larry. What makes you ask such
a question? Do you want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing special,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;I
was just wondering where he was.&rdquo; He did not
dare to tell the real reason for his inquiry, which
was prompted by a fear lest the kidnappers should
have been at work.</p>
<p>But his mind was soon set at rest, for Jimmy
came downstairs all excited over a new game he
had learned. He came in on the jump, but
stopped when he saw Larry propped up in his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you dead?&rdquo; he asked, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Larry, with a laugh. &ldquo;I
was in an accident, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it; every word,&rdquo; demanded the
little fellow.</p>
<p>So Larry had to go over it all again for the
benefit of his brother, whose eyes grew big, as
Larry told of the crash of the big stack and the
smashing of the shanty.</p>
<p>In the evening Mr. Newton called, and congratulated
Larry on his escape from possible injury,
if not death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Emberg thinks a heap of you, Larry,&rdquo;
said the older reporter. &ldquo;Your calling up on the
&rsquo;phone, and giving the story, in spite of being
hurt, shows, he says, that you&rsquo;re made of the
right kind of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anybody would have done what I did,&rdquo;
said Larry, modestly.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to be praised, however, and he
was glad that his efforts had been appreciated.
Larry wanted to talk about the blue-handed man,
and the threats the gang had made. He wanted
to ask Mr. Newton if anything new had developed,
but could get no chance, as Mrs. Dexter and
Lucy were within hearing distance all the while.
However, Mr. Newton must have guessed what
was in Larry&rsquo;s mind, for he said, in a low tone,
as he was leaving:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be over soon again, Larry, and I&rsquo;ll see if
we can&rsquo;t think of some scheme to land the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Larry was laid up about a week and a half.
He fretted over being kept in the house, when the
weather was so fine out of doors, but the doctor
said if his patient did not keep quiet, serious injury
might follow using the ankle too soon. At
length Larry was able to hobble about on
crutches, and then, a couple of days later, ventured
out on the sidewalk. He began to be more
hopeful after that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he heard every day from the office,
and Mr. Emberg sent messages of encouragement.
Larry was told to take as long as he
wanted to get well, as his salary would go on
just the same. When pay-night came Mr. Emberg
brought the young reporter his envelope,
for which Larry was very thankful.</p>
<p>At the end of two weeks Larry felt strong
enough to go back to work, provided he did not
have to run any races, or chase after cars. So,
one bright morning, walking with a slight limp
that was daily growing less, Larry went down to
the office. On the way he wondered whether he
would hear any more about the gang. They
seemed to have ceased operations, or if they had
not, they were biding their time. Larry received
no more warning letters, though he often looked
for them.</p>
<p>The young reporter was welcomed back to his
desk with considerable enthusiasm among his
colleagues. They said they had missed him, and
were glad to see him at work once again.</p>
<p>There was not much to do that day, and Larry
was told by Mr. Emberg to go home early.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to take in the circus,&rdquo; said the city
editor. &ldquo;It will do you good after having been
shut up in the house so long. I&rsquo;ll send for some
complimentary tickets for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some,&rdquo; put in Larry, telling about the
passes the lion-tamer had given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better go, take someone with
you, and enjoy the performance,&rdquo; the city editor
said.</p>
<p>Larry made up his mind he would take Jimmy,
who had done nothing but talk circus for the last
two weeks, and that evening, when the subject
was broached, the youngster stood on his head in
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can keep awake?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Dexter. &ldquo;The show lasts a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he can&rsquo;t keep awake at a circus,
mother, he&rsquo;s not much of a boy,&rdquo; spoke Larry,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll stay awake,&rdquo; Jimmy replied.</p>
<p>Jimmy thought the circus performance was
nothing short of fairyland. It was the first he had
been to since he was old enough to remember
things, and the one in New York had all the gorgeousness
that can be dreamed of.</p>
<p>Larry, too, enjoyed himself. He was particularly
interested in Nero, the lion, and pointed the
ugly beast out to Jimmy. The brute kept in one
corner of his cage, and growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His toothache bothers him yet,&rdquo; explained one
of the men, who remembered Larry&rsquo;s performance.
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to pull it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pull a lion&rsquo;s tooth?&rdquo; inquired Larry. &ldquo;I
never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often done,&rdquo; replied the trainer. &ldquo;Much
easier than yanking one from an elephant. If we
decide to extract a molar from Nero&rsquo;s jaw, I&rsquo;ll
send word down to the paper, if you leave me
your name, and you can get a story out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry thanked the man, and handed over a
business card. Then he and Jimmy went and sat
down in the seats where they could see the performance.
It was all fine and exciting, but the
stunt where the man seemed to be falling from
his trapeze seemed to make the biggest hit, and
Larry felt that he had a sort of proprietary interest
in it, from having seen it practiced.</p>
<p>However, as all good things must have an end,
the circus had one also, and the performance was
concluded shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sleepy?&rdquo; asked Larry of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied the little chap, struggling
to suppress a yawn. &ldquo;My eyes hurt, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Larry, laughing, as he took hold
of Jimmy&rsquo;s hand, and began leading him toward
an exit. There was a big crowd, and Larry soon
found himself and his brother in the midst of a
dense throng. He was pushed this way and
shoved that way. All the while he kept tight hold
of Jimmy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt the little fellow pulled away
from him. Larry looked down. There was no
trace of the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been separated from him in the
crush,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him outside the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried out, and rapidly scanned the crowd
for a glimpse of Jimmy. The boy was not in
sight, and Larry&rsquo;s heart began to sink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN ANXIOUS SEARCH</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s just mixed up in the crowd,&rdquo;
murmured Larry, trying to make himself believe
nothing harmful had befallen Jimmy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so
little that I can&rsquo;t see him. I&rsquo;ll soon find him,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Larry caught sight of a policeman he
knew, and hurried up to the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my little brother, Mr. Sullivan,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Where had I better start to look for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Larry, me boy!&rdquo; the officer exclaimed
good-naturedly, for he had taken quite a fancy
to the young reporter since Larry had given him
a little puff in the paper about stopping a runaway
horse. &ldquo;In trouble, eh? Well, I&rsquo;ll show you
what we do with lost children. We have a regular
place for &rsquo;em here in the Garden. They&rsquo;re always
gettin&rsquo; lost, and their fathers an&rsquo; mothers is half
crazy. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Officer Sullivan led the way to a small room
off the main offices of those in charge of the show.
It was an apartment fitted up for the care of lost
children. The management had found that scores
of tots whom their parents brought to the circus
got lost every day, and the policemen on duty at
the show had orders to bring them to the
&ldquo;nursery,&rdquo; as it was called. There were two
nurses and a matron in charge to look after the
little folk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lad to claim one of your lost children,
Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Sullivan, as he
took Larry to the matron. &ldquo;His little brother is
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he like?&rdquo; asked the matron.</p>
<p>Larry described Jimmy as well as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t believe I have your brother in here yet,
though I may get him at any moment. Now if
he was a year or two younger I&rsquo;m sure I could
fix you up, as I have some that answer his description
perfectly, except for age. You&rsquo;re sure you
can&rsquo;t be mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Larry, who was beginning
to become more worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you know, if you were not positive,
you might be mistaken,&rdquo; went on the matron. &ldquo;I
wish you could find your brother among those I
have. I&rsquo;d like to get rid of some of them. The
crop is unusually heavy to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>By this time the big Garden was beginning to
be pretty well cleared of the crowd. Mothers and
fathers who missed their children had begun to
drift in and claim them, being directed to the
&ldquo;nursery,&rdquo; by policemen in different parts of the
amusement place. One after another of the children
were taken away, until there was none left.
Little Jimmy had not been found.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s heart was like lead. He hardly dared
to go home, and tell his mother what had happened.
That the blue-handed gang had kidnapped
the boy Larry had no doubt. That was
why they had been following him around for the
last few weeks. Yet, even though he knew this
must be true, Larry hated to give in to the belief.</p>
<p>He stayed around the Garden for a long time,
until the men began to put the lights out, hoping
against hope that Jimmy would turn up somewhere.
But, at last, when it came time to close
the place, Larry could remain no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
the shock will make mother sick. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
not be harmed by the gang, and they&rsquo;ll give him
back to us as soon as mother and I agree to sign
the deed. I will put an advertisement in the
papers to-morrow&mdash;no! I&rsquo;ll do it to-night!
There&rsquo;s time enough yet. I must find Mr. Newton,
and tell him. He&rsquo;ll help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that he had decided on a plan of action,
Larry felt a little better. There&rsquo;s nothing so bad
for worry or grief as thinking of it. As soon
as one can get busy at something the spirits improve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>So it was in Larry&rsquo;s case. He started for Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s house, intending to ask his advice
about the wording of the notice to be put in the
morning papers. He had about an hour yet before
the time for taking advertisements would be
up.</p>
<p>As he was hurrying away he was hailed by
Officer Sullivan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye find him, Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t brought into the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry. Probably some policeman
farther down the street picked him up, and
took him to the nearest station-house. I&rsquo;ll turn
in an alarm for him, and you can inquire at headquarters
whether any lost children have been
picked up. Give me a description of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry did so, and then resumed his trip. He
made up his mind to stop at police headquarters
on his way back from Mr. Newton&rsquo;s, and then to
go home and tell his mother the sad news, provided
there was none better to relate.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton was much shocked when Larry
told what had happened. He made the youth
go over every incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s a bare possibility that the
gang has not kidnapped him,&rdquo; spoke the older
reporter, &ldquo;but it looks suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had I better do?&rdquo; asked Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid to go home and tell my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;But
before we go we&rsquo;ll get an advertisement ready.
We&rsquo;ll insert it in several papers. I don&rsquo;t believe
in giving in to these blackmailers, but I think in
this case we can set a trap for them by this advertisement.
I have been doing some work on
the case, and I think there&rsquo;ll be some developments
shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only knew that Jimmy was safe, I&rsquo;d not
worry so much,&rdquo; said Larry, with something like
a sob in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will be treated all right by the
gang,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton. &ldquo;It would not be
their policy to hurt him. They are only trying to
scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re succeeding pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newton got his hat, and, having written
several advertisements stating that a certain person
was ready to do what a certain blue-handed
man desired, provided a certain person was restored
to his home, he and Larry went out. They
headed for several newspaper offices on Park
Row, and soon the advertisement had been accepted,
and paid for. It was to appear under the
head of &ldquo;Personals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what good that will do,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Newton, as he reached the last office
just in time to have the notice taken for the next
day&rsquo;s paper. &ldquo;I think you had better be getting
home, too. Your mother will be worried at your
absence. I&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be more worried when I do get home,&rdquo;
remarked Larry, dubiously. &ldquo;But I suppose
there&rsquo;s no help for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Frightened enough was Mrs. Dexter when Mr.
Newton broke the news to her as gently as possible.
She grew pale, and then almost fainted,
while Mary and Lucy, when they heard the bad
tidings, began to cry, though Mary hardly knew
what for, save that something had happened to
make her mother sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you get down-hearted,&rdquo; advised
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find Jimmy for you just as
soon as we can. Maybe we&rsquo;ll have him for you
before morning. He may have been picked up by
some persons who saw he was lost, and they may
have taken him home. There are hundreds of
things that might have happened. You&rsquo;ll be
laughing at this scare in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dexter, with
a sigh.</p>
<p>Leaving Larry to comfort his mother as best
he could, Mr. Newton set off to make a trip
to police headquarters. He wanted to be sure
that Jimmy was not lost in the usual manner in
which hundreds of New York children are lost
every week. From the sergeant in charge Mr.
Newton learned that the usual number of little
ones had been picked up. They were at the various
precinct station-houses, awaiting owners.
Some had been there since early morning, their
mothers either having forgotten all about them,
or else thinking they were safe at some relative&rsquo;s
or neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>None of the unclaimed ones, however, answered
the description of Larry&rsquo;s brother. They
were too young or too old, too large or too small,
or had some other feature about them that precluded
any chance of one being Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your best on this case, Tom,&rdquo; Mr. Newton
said to the sergeant behind the desk, as he was
leaving. &ldquo;Send out a general alarm. The child&rsquo;s a
little brother of a reporter on the <i>Leader</i>, and a
friend of mine. If you hear anything during
the night from any of the precincts, call me up.
I have a &rsquo;phone in the house, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised the sergeant. &ldquo;I hope they
find the little lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather tired, but not discouraged, Mr. Newton
went home. He knew the police would do their
best, as many of them were friends of his, and,
besides, the bluecoats had a very good feeling
toward the <i>Leader</i>, as it had advocated higher
pay for the police and firemen, and the measure
had passed the Legislature, so there was in line
with his duty nothing a bluecoat would not do
for the <i>Leader</i>.</p>
<p>But the night wore on, and there came no word
to Mr. Newton concerning Jimmy. The reporter
went to bed about two o&rsquo;clock, leaving word for
the elevator attendant to awaken him in time to
get to work at the usual hour.</p>
<p>In their rooms, waiting, and hoping against
hope, sat Mrs. Dexter, Larry, and Lucy. Mary
had fallen asleep. It was a sad household, though
Larry tried hard to make his mother feel that
there was no danger to Jimmy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help crying,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dexter.
&ldquo;My little boy has never been away from me a
night in his life. He&rsquo;ll cry so hard, and be so
frightened at those rough men! Oh, Larry!
Why did they do it? Let them have all they ask,
only get Jimmy back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the men who are after the property
have not got Jimmy,&rdquo; suggested Larry, hoping
to cheer up his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been kidnapped!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I feel that he has. I only hope they
will not harm him,&rdquo; and the poor woman began
to cry softly again, in spite of the efforts Lucy
and Larry made to comfort her.</p>
<p>Thus the long night wore on; none in the Dexter
household, save little Mary, sleeping more than
a few minutes at a time. Every now and then
one of them would awaken, thinking they heard
someone coming, bringing what might prove
joyful news, but each time it was a false alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE ENEMY&rsquo;S POWER</span></h2>
<p>When Jimmy, holding tightly to Larry&rsquo;s
hand, started away from the bench in the Garden
where he had watched the wonderful show, the little
fellow&rsquo;s mind was in a tumult at what he had
seen. It was one endless round of delight for
him, and he was sorry that it was over, that the
people were going home, and that the performers
had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see the animals again,&rdquo; begged
Jimmy, but Larry was too intent on getting out
of the crowd to pay any attention to the request.</p>
<p>Just at that moment a lad, who seemed to be
about the same age as Larry, stepped up behind
Jimmy, who was lagging in the rear. He cast a
sharp look at the young reporter and his little
brother, and, when the small chap asked to be
taken once more to the animals, the youth seemed
to be much excited.</p>
<p>He leaned over and whispered to Jimmy, taking
good care that Larry did not see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come with me I&rsquo;ll take you to the animals,&rdquo;
the youth said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see the elephants,
the tigers, the lions, the zebras, and the horses.
Come on, Jimmy, and we&rsquo;ll have a good time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>It was done in an instant, but, swift and low
as the voice was, the little boy heard and understood.
Still he remembered what his mother had
said to him about keeping tight hold of Larry&rsquo;s
hand. The strange youth seemed to understand
this, for he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we see the animals we&rsquo;ll come back to
Larry. Don&rsquo;t let him know about this, for the
animals might all run away, and we wouldn&rsquo;t see
them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled it for Jimmy. He was ready to
do anything to see the wild beasts again, and
was willing to keep quiet for fear of scaring them
away.</p>
<p>So, almost before he knew what he was doing,
Jimmy had released his hold of Larry&rsquo;s hand, and
clasped that of the strange youth who promised
such delights as unlimited quantities of wild animals.</p>
<p>Once he had hold of Jimmy, the youth made
his way rapidly through the crowd. He dodged
this way and that, pulling the little chap along,
half dragging him at times, until Jimmy, from
very weariness, cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please show me the wild animals. I&rsquo;m awful
tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be there,&rdquo; the lad went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just around the next corner, and down a little
ways. Oh, but you&rsquo;ll see the finest lot of animals
that ever got into a circus!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>That satisfied Jimmy for a while, and he
trudged on, not noticing that the crowd was thinning
out, that his leader had left the Garden, and
was walking along the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the animals?&rdquo; asked the little boy,
who was beginning to feel that all was not right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little further now,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;They are feeding the polar bear, and the lion is
mad because they didn&rsquo;t give him his supper first,
so we&rsquo;ll have to wait a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed reasonable to Jimmy, who knew
that bears and lions were fierce beasts, and had
to be humored. So he said nothing, only he wondered
more and more why he had been taken
away from the music and lights, and the companionship
of his brother. But he was so small
that he had no suspicions.</p>
<p>On and on the two trudged. They had left the
well-lighted streets, and were in a dark section
of the city, where only an occasional gas lamp
gave a fitful gleam that illuminated a small circle,
and seemed to leave the rest in denser blackness
than if there had been no light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; Jimmy said, after a while. &ldquo;I
want to go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; we&rsquo;ll go home after we see the animals!&rdquo;
said the youth, who seemed much elated
over something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to see any animals! Want to go
home!&rdquo; Jimmy cried. &ldquo;I want Larry! Take me
to Larry!&rdquo; and he began to sob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute!&rdquo; the lad leading him exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you the finest
steam engine you ever saw, and I&rsquo;ll let you turn
on the steam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest and truly?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, his mind
suddenly turned from the idea of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just around
the corner. Come on, now, before it gets away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Jimmy hurried, full of glee at what
had always been one of his childish ambitions&mdash;to
run a steam-engine. The youth leading him
went down many streets, until it seemed to the
little fellow they must have traversed several
miles. But Jimmy did not think of complaining,
though he was very tired. His feet lagged behind
now and again, however, and the youth
leading him noticed this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor kid, I sort of hate to do this,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I have to, or lose my job, and I never could
get another after what I&rsquo;ve done. I wish I could
take a car, but someone might see us, and then
the jig would be up. It isn&rsquo;t much farther, that&rsquo;s
one good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been talking to himself in a low tone,
and now and then he looked down on Jimmy to
see how the little boy was standing the journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it much farther?&rdquo; asked the small lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. Just you think about the steam-engine,
and you&rsquo;ll not notice how tired you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to,&rdquo; replied Jimmy, blinking to
keep back the tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>The youth chose the darkest and least-frequented
streets, and seemed anxious to escape observation,
as he led Jimmy along. Once he saw
a policeman standing under a gas-lamp, and, at
the sight of the bluecoat, the youth darted across
the street, and slunk along in the shadow, keeping
Jimmy on the side farthest away from the
officer, at the same time cautioning the little boy
to remain quiet, and not speak.</p>
<p>Down a side street that was more gloomy and
lonesome than any they had yet traversed, the
youth led his captive. There was, here and there,
a gas-lamp, but it seemed to make the darkness
only more intense. Strange-looking figures
flitted here and there out of the shadows, apparently
afraid of what little light there was.</p>
<p>Figures there were with loosely-fitting clothes,
wide sleeves to the jackets, and wide trousers.
On their feet were shoes with thick soles, and
some of them had long braids of hair hanging
down their backs. Jimmy caught sight of one,
and huddled closer to the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Chinaman!&rdquo; the little fellow exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he&rsquo;s a Chinaman,&rdquo; the youth agreed.
&ldquo;I call &rsquo;em Chinks. Nobody here calls &rsquo;em Chinamen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; repeated Jimmy. He always had
had a sort of horror of the almond-eyed Celestials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; the youth assured him.
&ldquo;This is where they live. This is Chinatown.
You&rsquo;ll have lots of fun. I know a Chink that&rsquo;ll
make you a fine kite that&rsquo;ll sail away up in the
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; asked the little boy, his fear temporarily
gone at the mention of the kite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, if you&rsquo;re a good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get the kite, and give it to me,&rdquo; pleaded
Jimmy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-skeered to have a Chinaman
come near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; agreed the youth. Then
in a lower tone he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing
he is afraid. It will keep him from trying to
escape. The house is full of Chinks, and he&rsquo;ll
not try to leave the room after I get him in. I&rsquo;ll
have an easier time than I thought I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on past several dark houses. Now
and then a door would open, letting a glimmer of
light out from the hall. The portal would close
quickly again, and the figure that had come out
would slink along as though afraid of being seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; the youth exclaimed, coming
to a halt in front of a three-storied building that
was darker and more gloomy-looking than any
they had yet passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the steam-engine here?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the kite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. Come along, now, kid, and don&rsquo;t make
any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Hardly able to drag one foot after another, so
tired was he, Jimmy followed his captor to the
stairs. Up two flights they went, until they came
to the third-floor hall, then along that corridor
until they reached a door that had a crude drawing
of the rising sun painted upon it. The youth
gave three raps, paused a second, rapped four
times, and then thirteen times in quick succession.
A little panel in the door opened, and a voice
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mikado&rsquo;s messenger,&rdquo; was the youth&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;Hurry up and let me in; don&rsquo;t go
through all the usual foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he bring?&rdquo; the voice proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A watermelon,&rdquo; was the youth&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Come on now, Jake, it&rsquo;s only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mention no names!&rdquo; exclaimed the voice,
seemingly in anger. &ldquo;Remember your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the door opened, and the
youth, pushing Jimmy in front of him, entered,
when the portal was quickly shut. The man who
had been at the slide locked and barred the door,
and then followed the youth and Jimmy down a
passage that led toward a room where a light
glowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo; asked a voice from the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; I&rsquo;ve got the kid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! Good for you, Peter!&rdquo; and then, as the
youth and Jimmy entered the room, a man, who
seemed to be scrubbing his hands at a sink, looked
up, and laughed. &ldquo;Good enough, Peter,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what our friend Larry Dexter
has to say now. He&rsquo;ll sing a different tune, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you doing?&rdquo; asked Peter Manton, for
it was the old copy boy of the <i>Leader</i> who had
kidnapped Jimmy, and delivered him into the
power of the gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to get rid of that blue stuff on my
hands,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It sticks worse
than a porous plaster. I&rsquo;ll not dare to go out
now, for that reporter, Newton, will have every
detective in New York looking for me, and if
they see my hands, even in gloves, they&rsquo;ll nab me,
and the game will be up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll suspect you?&rdquo; asked
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspect? They probably know for a certainty
that I&rsquo;m mixed up in this. Those reporters
are no fools. They&rsquo;re better than half the detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they suspect me?&rdquo; asked Peter, with
something like a whimper in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, and if they get us you&rsquo;ll have to
take your medicine with the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d protect me,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will as much as I can,&rdquo; replied the blue-handed
man, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t fight the whole police
force. I&rsquo;ve done pretty well as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want the steam-engine and the kite,&rdquo; said
Jimmy, his voice trembling. &ldquo;I want to go home!
I want Larry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep him quiet,&rdquo; the blue-handed
man said. &ldquo;Give him something to eat, and get
out some kind of Chinese toys. He&rsquo;ll be asleep
pretty soon, if I&rsquo;m any judge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIMMY HELD CAPTIVE</span></h2>
<p>Jimmy was ready to burst into tears. He had
kept his courage up under the strangeness of being
taken away from Larry, by the promise of
the animals first, then the steam-engine, and next
the kite. When none of these was forthcoming,
the boy felt that he had been fooled, and this
made him feel badly. Then, too, he was really
frightened by the darkness and the strange man
and place to which he had been brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, kid!&rdquo; called Peter, after rummaging
in a closet, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a fine jumping-jack,&rdquo; and he
gave Jimmy a Chinese toy.</p>
<p>It was arranged so that, by pressing two pieces
of wood which formed the handle of the jumping-jack,
the manikin would cut all sorts of queer
capers. For a while this served to take Jimmy&rsquo;s
mind off his troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get him something to eat,&rdquo; the blue-handed
man ordered Peter. &ldquo;The rest of the fellows
will be coming here pretty soon, and we&rsquo;ll
have to talk business. Go out and get him some
pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pie&rsquo;s no good for kids,&rdquo; remarked Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, I used to like it when I was a
youngster,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give him the nightmare, and keep him
awake,&rdquo; spoke Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better give him crackers
and milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, whatever you say. It&rsquo;s so long
since I&rsquo;ve had anything to do with babies that I
don&rsquo;t know what they need. Now don&rsquo;t you
worry,&rdquo; the blue-handed man went on, turning to
Jimmy, while Peter got out the food. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
we had to bring you here, but we&rsquo;ll take good care
of you, and if your friends do the right thing,
you&rsquo;ll soon be allowed to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go now,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to let you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; spoke the
man, &ldquo;if only that brother of yours would do
what we want him to in the matter of land, we
would. But, of course, you don&rsquo;t understand
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Peter had fixed some crackers and
milk for the little fellow, who was quite hungry.
The blue-handed man resumed the work of trying
to remove the stains of nitro-glycerine from
his fingers, and while he ate Jimmy watched him
curiously.</p>
<p>In a little while, however, Jimmy&rsquo;s eyes began
to grow more and more heavy, his head nodded
lower and lower, and, almost before he knew
it, he had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off,&rdquo; announced Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, put him to bed,&rdquo; instructed the blue-handed
man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s out of the way.
Here come some of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Peter was carrying Jimmy to a bed in an
inner room, the sound of steps was heard in the
hall. Then came the odd raps, such as Peter had
given, and the questions and answers. Then the
blue-handed man admitted three other men.
They went to the main room, and while Peter
prepared to go to bed in the same apartment
where Jimmy was, all of the men sat about the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; asked one of the newcomers.
&ldquo;Getting the stains off, Noddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep quiet about those stains,&rdquo;
said the blue-handed man, rather angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
having trouble enough over them. But, for all
that, I&rsquo;ve done more than you have, Sam Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one, Larry or his brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His brother. Peter copped him to-night at
the circus. He&rsquo;s here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; exclaimed Perkins. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
something like. Now we can go ahead with that
land business. Alderman Beacham was saying
the other day, if we didn&rsquo;t pull the thing off pretty
soon the committee would have to make a report.
Once the thing becomes public our chance of
making a fortune is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that Larry will come to time now,&rdquo;
remarked Noddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for a personal from
him in the papers to-morrow, saying he&rsquo;s ready
to sign the deed. I&rsquo;m getting tired of keeping the
paper around. It&rsquo;s a dangerous document to be
found on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you have it in a safe place,&rdquo; remarked
one of the men, who had not yet spoken save to
greet Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safest place in the world,&rdquo; replied Noddy.
He pointed to a mantelpiece, on which were a
number of objects. One was what seemed to be
a folded newspaper stuck behind a vase, and half
showing. &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he said, indicating the
newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that very secure,&rdquo; remarked Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, because it&rsquo;s so simple,&rdquo; argued Noddy.
&ldquo;If I had it in a safe or a strong-box, that
would be the first place they would look for
it if they broke in. But they&rsquo;d never think of
unfolding that piece of newspaper, because it&rsquo;s
so common. They&rsquo;d say to themselves that I&rsquo;d
never be so foolish as to leave it in plain sight
that way, and so they&rsquo;d pass over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; admitted Dick Randall,
the man who had asked about the deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the next thing on the programme?&rdquo;
asked Noddy, after the men had
lighted cigars which he produced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait a few days until we hear from
Larry, I think,&rdquo; spoke Perkins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if he don&rsquo;t answer, and agree to do as we
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll have to drop him a gentle
hint that something is liable to happen to the kid
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the little fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed
Noddy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bad enough and desperate enough,
as all of you know, but if there&rsquo;s going to be any
game that includes hurting a little chap, you can
not only cut me out of it, but I&rsquo;ll not stand for
it, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the blue-handed man seemed
to be very much in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting chicken-hearted?&rdquo; sneered Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can call it what you like,&rdquo; went on
Noddy, looking at his stained hands, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
as low as that yet. I want this deal to go through
as much as any of you fellows, but I&rsquo;ll not step
over a certain line, and the sooner you know it
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ll peach on us?&rdquo;
asked Randall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless I have to,&rdquo; answered Noddy,
calmly. &ldquo;It depends on how far you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noddy&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; remarked Randall, with a
wink at the other two. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m opposed to hurting
the child. We&rsquo;ll only use him for scaring Larry
and his mother into doing what we want. After
all, we&rsquo;re giving the young cub and the widow a
fair price for this land. We&rsquo;re taking a lot of
risks, and it&rsquo;s only fair we should be paid for &rsquo;em.
It isn&rsquo;t as if we were trying to get the land for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m with you in anything reasonable,&rdquo;
spoke the blue-handed man. &ldquo;Only, don&rsquo;t hurt
the little kid. That&rsquo;s my last word. I used to
have a little boy once&mdash;before I went to the bad,&rdquo;
and he turned his head away.</p>
<p>For a long time the gang sat up and discussed
their programme. Their talk revealed that they
had laid a well-planned plot to get possession of
Jimmy, in order to have a hold over Larry. They
had watched and schemed to kidnap him, but
Larry&rsquo;s watchfulness had foiled them a number
of times. At last, as has been seen, the opportunity
came most unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Peter, who had been appointed to shadow
Larry at different times, watched him set out for
the circus. The former copy boy, whom association
with bad men had made sharp-witted, had
seen his chance in the Garden, and taken advantage
of it.</p>
<p>Jimmy had been brought to one of the worst
dens in New York&rsquo;s Chinatown. It was hired
by a gang of white men who were worse than
the lowest Celestial criminals. The room, the
door of which had a rising sun painted on it, was
the headquarters of a notorious band of men.</p>
<p>The existence of the gang was known to the
police, but so cunning were the members, and so
elusive were they, that few, and only the least
important, had ever been arrested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>It was into the power of this gang and to their
headquarters that Jimmy had been brought, a
fate which his worst enemy, provided he had one,
would never have wished him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might as well break up,&rdquo; said Randall,
at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we can do anything more,&rdquo;
remarked Perkins, &ldquo;unless our legal friend here,
Mr. Snyder, has some advice to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the third member of the party,
who had not yet spoken, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll let things
take their course. When I think you need advice
I&rsquo;ll give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, and rubbed his hands together as
though he was wrapping up ill-gotten money. He
was a lawyer who had once been a brilliant member
of the bar, but whose tricky practices had
driven him from the courts. Now he was the
official legal adviser of the Rising Sun crowd,
and many was the scrape he had helped them
out of. He also planned some crimes, and assisted
in carrying them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get along, then,&rdquo; said the blue-handed
man. &ldquo;I want to close up here, and get some
sleep. I&rsquo;ve got a family on my hands now,&rdquo; and
he laughed in a mirthless sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you to-morrow night,&rdquo; remarked
Perkins. &ldquo;We may have some news by then
that will relieve you of your charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; spoke Noddy, locking the
door, as the three men went softly out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>He listened to their footsteps dying away down
the hall. Then Noddy went into the room where
Peter and Jimmy were. Both had fallen asleep;
Jimmy&rsquo;s face tear-stained, for he had wept when
he found there were neither kites, steam-engines,
nor even Larry to comfort him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little kid,&rdquo; sighed the blue-handed man.
&ldquo;I wish you were out of this. I&rsquo;m sorry I ever
went into the game, but now I&rsquo;m in I suppose
I&rsquo;ll have to stay. Well, if they try to hurt you
they&rsquo;ll have me to reckon with,&rdquo; and then, with
another look at the little boy, and wiping what
might have been tears from his eyes, Noddy went
to his own bedroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SEARCHING FOR THE LOST</span></h2>
<p>When the Dexter household awoke the morning
after the night on which Jimmy had disappeared,
it seemed as if it was all a bad dream or
nightmare. It did not seem possible that the little
fellow was missing, and Larry, as he roused
himself from his uneasy slumbers, and jumped
out of bed, was half inclined to believe that it was
all only a vision of the darkness.</p>
<p>But the absence of Jimmy&rsquo;s cheerful call, silence
in his room, and the lack of the child&rsquo;s
merry laugh, soon emphasized the fact that he
was missing.</p>
<p>No one felt like eating breakfast, and Mrs.
Dexter was so much affected that Larry feared
she would become ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, mother,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;you must
not worry so. I&rsquo;ll admit there&rsquo;s lots of cause for
it, but we&rsquo;ll find Jimmy sooner or later. He can&rsquo;t
be hurt. He&rsquo;s probably, as I said, been taken by
that gang, but it&rsquo;s to their interest to keep him
safe. He has a claim on the property the same
as you or I have, and if any&mdash;any harm came to
him it would only mix things up for them. You
can depend on it, they&rsquo;ll take very good care of
Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;Besides we&rsquo;ll have
him back in a few days, no matter where he is.
Mr. Newton and I will start on the search. The
<i>Leader</i> will help us, and all the police in the city
will lend a hand, as they are friendly toward our
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, mother,&rdquo; chimed in Lucy.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, and I&rsquo;m sure it will all come out
right. I feel that Jimmy will come back safe to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dexter, wiping the tears
from her eyes, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a terrible thing to have a
little boy kidnapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry made a light breakfast, and hurried to
the office. Early as he was, he found Mr. Newton
there before him. The older reporter showed the
strain he was under, for he had slept but little.
Pretty soon Mr. Emberg came in.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton soon explained the situation to
the editor, and asked for a leave of absence for
Larry and himself to enable them to trace down
the gang and locate Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may go,&rdquo; said the city editor.
&ldquo;Call on the <i>Leader</i> for any help you want, financial
or otherwise. If you can get at this gang
and break it up, or if you can get at the bottom
of this land deal and make a story out of it, so
much the better. Have your own way, your time
is your own. Come back to work, Larry, when
you find your brother and clear up the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>With this roving commission, Larry and Mr.
Newton started away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Larry,&rdquo; remarked the older reporter,
&ldquo;we seem to be sort of up against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Larry, helplessly.
&ldquo;Mother is almost sick from worry, and
if we don&rsquo;t find Jimmy soon I don&rsquo;t know what
will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry,&rdquo; spoke Mr. Newton, solemnly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
going to find the little fellow. I don&rsquo;t pose as
a prophet, and my predictions don&rsquo;t always come
true, but I&rsquo;m going to succeed in this, and we&rsquo;re
not going to give in to those scoundrels, either.
There&rsquo;s something big in this for you and your
mother, or I&rsquo;m greatly mistaken. Otherwise the
gang would not be so anxious to get that land.
But we&rsquo;re going to let that go for a while, and
work only on clews that will lead to finding your
brother. We&rsquo;ll begin at the beginning, which is
at the Garden, where he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two reporters went to where the circus was
holding forth. It was about ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, and the big arena had a very different
appearance from the night before, when thousands
of lights lent a glamour to the scene, and
when gayly-dressed men and women added to the
brilliance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>Now everything was dark and dreary. A few
men, seemingly too tired to move, were fixing
up some of the apparatus, and others were sweeping
and dusting. It was a glance behind the
scenes with everything at its worst.</p>
<p>Mr. Newton knew several of the managers of
the departments, and soon was in conversation
with them. He wanted to find out who of the
circus men were on duty at the gate Larry and
Jimmy left by.</p>
<p>From the man who kept the list of employees
Mr. Newton learned exactly what he wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Bill Lynch,&rdquo; the bookkeeper said.
&ldquo;Maybe he can help you, but he&rsquo;ll not be here
until near noon. He&rsquo;s on guard at No. 16 entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was tedious waiting for Lynch, but at last
he came in. Larry and Mr. Newton made a dash
for him, almost before the man had his coat off,
preparatory to donning his uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, a hold-up?&rdquo; he asked, good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hold-up for information,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;We want to know something about a boy
who is missing, and who is supposed to have
passed out the gate where you stood last night,&rdquo;
and the reporter described Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lands!&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember
every boy I see. I don&rsquo;t take notice of the thousands
that pass by me every night. If I did I&rsquo;d
go crazy. All I do is to see that they keep order.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he was with me,&rdquo; put in Larry. &ldquo;I had
hold of his hand, and I was leading him out,
when he asked me to come and see the animals
again. But I was in too much of a hurry to get
out to pay any attention to him. Now can&rsquo;t you
remember? Right after that I missed him, and
made a lot of inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember there was quite some stir about
a missing boy last night,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Lynch,
&ldquo;but that happens so often I paid no attention to
it. But now that you speak of it, I do seem to
recall something about a boy begging to be taken
to see the animals again. It was rather odd, I
call to mind now, I was thinking, that a lad who
had seen all the trapeze stunts inside would be
wanting to go back to the animals. Most of &rsquo;em,
as soon as they comes out, asks their fathers or
mothers to buy &rsquo;em a trapeze, or some flying
rings. But I recall I heard one little lad asking
to be taken to the animals, and possibly it&rsquo;s the
one you&rsquo;re inquiring of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;What
happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I can recollect,&rdquo; went on Mr.
Lynch, &ldquo;I heard someone tell him to come with
him, and he&rsquo;d see the beasts. Didn&rsquo;t you take
him yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;Try and think, Mr.
Lynch, what sort of a person it was enticed him
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>The doorkeeper seemed lost in thought. He
pondered over the matter, striving to bring back
to his mind the scene he had almost forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There was
a lad about your age,&rdquo; indicating Larry, &ldquo;who
came up behind the little chap, and said something
about taking him to see the animals. I
didn&rsquo;t pay much attention, for I thought you were
all together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a boy was this one you speak
of?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was what I&rsquo;d call a bold-looking
lad,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Not a nice sort of a chap
at all, though he seemed smart.&rdquo; He proceeded
to describe the boy more fully when Mr. Newton
interrupted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know who he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; cried Larry. &ldquo;It was Peter Manton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very one I had in mind,&rdquo; spoke Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;That only proves what we believed all
along. It is the gang with the blue-handed man
at the head that has Jimmy. Peter is only one
of the tools. Yet we may be able to get a clew
through him. He&rsquo;s liable to make a false move,
not being as well versed in crime as the older
ones. I think we are beginning to see daylight,
Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a pretty faint clew,&rdquo; objected Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, but we can&rsquo;t expect everything.
We&rsquo;ve got a clew quicker than I expected
we would. Now we will have to develop it and
work it up. I&rsquo;m sure it will lead to something.
We must get on the trail of Peter. Do you think
you could do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; answered Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll split up this work,&rdquo; went on the
older reporter. &ldquo;You devote your time to locating
Peter, or find out where he hangs out. If
you get a chance, follow him. Sooner or later
he&rsquo;ll go to the headquarters of the gang. I&rsquo;ll
work on another end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start my investigations from the
sign of the blue hand,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from the place in Chinatown where you
were nearly injured by those men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do. But don&rsquo;t be
alarmed. There&rsquo;s no one at that place now. The
gang moved out soon after I traced them there,
and have not been back since. I learned that
from some detectives. So there&rsquo;s no danger in
going back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good will it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may put me on the track of the gang&rsquo;s new
headquarters. That it is somewhere in Chinatown
I&rsquo;m certain, but to locate it is a harder
proposition. I may be able to make friends with
someone in the house where the room with the
sign of the blue hand on the door is located, and
he may be able to tell me where the members of
the gang hold out. Once I get a clew the rest
will be comparatively easy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll succeed,&rdquo; spoke Larry.
&ldquo;In the meanwhile I&rsquo;ll see if I can locate Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arranging to meet again late that night at
Mr. Newton&rsquo;s house, Larry and his friend separated.
The boy hardly knew where to begin.
Without experience in this sort of work, for which
Mr. Newton&rsquo;s training as a newspaper reporter
fitted him, Larry thought the only way to do
would be to walk about the streets, taking a chance
of seeing Peter in the crowds that passed by. He
even tried this plan, but he saw that it would be
apt to fail, since the chances were so much against
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to start at the beginning,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That is, if I knew where the beginning was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it occurred to him that the most natural
way would be to find out where Peter lived, or
had lived, and to go there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why I didn&rsquo;t think of that at first?&rdquo;
mused Larry. &ldquo;Of course I should have. I&rsquo;ll go
back to the office. They&rsquo;ll probably have Peter&rsquo;s
address on the payroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to the <i>Leader</i> office he went. He explained
what he wanted to Mr. Emberg, who
soon ascertained from the cashier&rsquo;s books where
the former copy boy had lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he probably doesn&rsquo;t live there now,&rdquo; said
the city editor. &ldquo;This was nearly a year ago.
He&rsquo;s likely moved since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trace him!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
on his trail and find him, if he&rsquo;s in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN QUEST OF PETER</span></h2>
<p>The address Larry had as that where Peter
had lived took him to a poor, though respectable,
part of the city. It was pretty well uptown,
on the East Side, and the young reporter soon
found himself in a thickly-settled tenement district.
The streets were filled with children,
among whom pushcart peddlers shoved their
vehicles laden with everything from fish to calico,
and from books to suspenders. After some search
Larry located the house where Peter had resided.</p>
<p>There were five floors, and four families lived
on each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes twenty places to inquire, if I don&rsquo;t
strike the fight place first,&rdquo; reasoned Larry.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like hunting a needle in a haystack,
but it&rsquo;s got to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knocked at the door of the first apartment
on the first floor. No one answered, and Larry
tapped again, this time quite loudly. Suddenly
a door across the hall opened, and a woman stuck
her head out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Peter Manton live here?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat is?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Larry repeated his question, at the same time
coming closer to the door, thinking the woman
had not heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ich weiss nicht</i>,&rdquo; she replied, that being the
German equivalent for &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and then,
having satisfied her curiosity, she closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s what most of &rsquo;em will say,&rdquo; remarked
Larry, who understood a little German.</p>
<p>He was about to knock on the third door of the
first floor, when a boy stuck his head out of one
apartment, and of him Larry asked where Peter
lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he a wart on his nose?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Larry, who knew Peter was not
marked in any such way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he squint with his left eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he turn a double somersault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is one of his front teeth gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, his teeth are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know him. All the fellers I
know has something the matter with &rsquo;em, or else
they can do somethin&rsquo;. I guess the feller you want
has moved away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Larry did not want to trust to any chances.
He went to the next floor, and made inquiries
without success. Then he proceeded to the third
floor. At the last apartment where he knocked
an old man came to the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, mine friendt?&rdquo; he inquired, and Larry
was beginning to think all the people in the house
were German Jews. &ldquo;Vat can I do for you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Peter Manton?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter vat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Manton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he sell suspenders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collar buttons, maybe yet, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den he keeps a store alretty yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, vell, den I doan knows him by yet. I
only know peoples vat is in business. Run avay,
leedle poy, an&rsquo; doan bodder mit a business man,&rdquo;
and then, while Larry watched him, the old fellow
went back, leaving his door open, and proceeded
to resume his slumbers in an easy-chair,
whence Larry had aroused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll get very little information here,&rdquo;
thought the searcher. Yet he would not give up.
Not until he had knocked at the last door did he
get any trace, and that came when he had almost
despaired.</p>
<p>A woman answered the door, and, at the sight
of Larry, she began to scream in a loud voice,
and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goniff! Goniff! Goniff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a thief!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, for he
recognized the Yiddish word for robber, having
heard it in his travels about the Jewish quarter
of New York. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t stolen anything, and
don&rsquo;t intend to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke sharply, for he feared the woman&rsquo;s
cries would rouse the neighborhood, and, perhaps,
make trouble for him. Fortunately, however,
there was much noise caused by the children
in the street shouting, and no one appeared to
pay much attention to the woman&rsquo;s exclamations.</p>
<p>In a little while, when she saw that Larry had
no evil designs, and did not attempt to steal her
brass candlesticks or brass samovar, or tea-brewing
apparatus, her two choicest possessions, the
woman became calmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Peter Manton?&rdquo; asked Larry,
who was beginning to tire of his own question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hass he got funny eyes alretty yet?&rdquo; asked
the woman. &ldquo;Eyes not like yours, vat look one
in the face, but eyes vat always move about
so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she shifted hers rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; replied Larry, recognizing one
of Peter&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; the woman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; cried Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; the woman requested, opening the
door wider. &ldquo;You must excuse me, young gentlemans.
I am all alone here, and ven you comes
by my door I t&rsquo;ou&rsquo;t you vas a robbers yet. Once
alretty dey comes and takes mine moneys. So I
am of a carefulness when I goes py de door.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Then, as Larry questioned her, she told in
broken English how Peter had once lived in the
house on the same floor she did. She remembered
him because he was always playing tricks on her
little nephew who had lived with her. But Peter
had moved away, she said, and she did not know
where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; begged Larry, to whom
finding the former copy boy meant so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vas so glad to see him go I care not where
he lives yet,&rdquo; the woman answered. &ldquo;But he has
an aunt vat lives somewheres about t&rsquo;ree blocks
from here. Maybe she can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry got the location of Peter&rsquo;s aunt, and with
a somewhat lighter heart he set off to the address
the Jewish woman had given him.</p>
<p>He had a little difficulty in finding Mrs. Jackson,
the former copy boy&rsquo;s aunt, as she had moved
twice since the Jewish woman knew of her, but
eventually Larry discovered her. At first she was
very guarded in her answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know for?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Then Larry told her as much of the story of
his missing brother as he thought necessary. He
described how he came to believe Peter had a
hand in taking him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always knew Peter would come to no good
end,&rdquo; said his aunt. &ldquo;I warned my brother to
whip him at least once a day to make him a better
boy, but he would not, and now see what he
has come to. Well, if I can help you, young man,
I will. I&rsquo;d just like to get hold of Peter,&rdquo; and
she looked as though Peter&rsquo;s experience under her
administration would be anything but pleasant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>She looked over some old letters, and from
them got the address of Peter&rsquo;s father, who had
died some time before, leaving the boy in charge
of a stepmother. To that address Larry went,
only to find that the stepmother had married
again, and gone away. Neighbors said Peter
had not been seen about the place where he used
to live, in some time. Larry was about to leave,
when a boy, about his own age, who had heard
his questions, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Larry, his heart beating high
with hope again. &ldquo;Tell me where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you where he is,&rdquo; the boy answered,
&ldquo;but I know he hangs out in Chinatown.
You go down there, and near the end of Pell
Street is a Chinese grocery, with a funny image
in the window. The image has a red stone in
one eye, and none in the other. I know, &rsquo;cause I
went with Peter once, when he was going to have
me join a gang of fellers, only my mother
wouldn&rsquo;t let me. They used to meet over that
grocery. Maybe he ain&rsquo;t there now, but he used
to be. You&rsquo;ll see the image in the winder. The
gang he belongs to was called the Red Eye
Gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Thanking the lad for his information Larry
hurried away. He felt that at last he was on the
trail, and wanted to follow it up at once. He
made his way to Chinatown, and was soon in that
section of the city where so much crime abounds.</p>
<p>He had seldom been there, for only the older
reporters were sent on stories in that locality. It
was not altogether safe in daytime, and at night
it must be a bold man who would venture there
alone.</p>
<p>At first all the streets seemed made up of groceries
and Chinese laundries. Pell Street appeared
to be one continuous string of them, and
each one seemed to have some sort of an image
or idol in the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have my own troubles picking
out the place,&rdquo; thought Larry. &ldquo;They all look
alike. However, I&rsquo;ll be on the watch for the one-eyed
image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had almost reached the end of Pell Street
when, in the window of a small store, that seemed
to be trying to hide away from sight between two
larger ones, he spied a big wooden idol in the
window. Before it burned a number of Joss
sticks, and, as Larry placed his nose against the
pane, he discerned dimly through the smoke that
the image had one eye, made of a red stone, but
that the socket of the other was empty, giving an
odd expression to the grinning face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the place,&rdquo; thought Larry, his
heart beating rapidly with hope. He looked up
at the windows. They were screened with red
curtains, and seemed never to have been washed.
There was a door leading to a hallway at one side
of the grocery entrance. Larry resolved to try
the store first. He found a fat Chinese smoking
behind a counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; bloy wan&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired the Celestial.
&ldquo;Glot nice clulumbler, melon sleed, ginger loot,
nuts. Wha&rsquo; bloy want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to buy anything,&rdquo; Larry explained,
speaking slowly, so the almond-eyed one
could understand him. &ldquo;Do you know anybody
named Peter Manton? He&rsquo;s a boy I&rsquo;m looking
for. Do you know Peter Manton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer of the Chinese was no less prompt
than it was startling. He leaped to his feet, dropping
his pipe to the floor, and seizing a heavy vase
from the counter threw it straight at Larry&rsquo;s head.
The boy ducked only just in time, and the ornament
was shattered against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I show you, Pleter Manton!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Celestial, running from behind the counter, while
Larry, who had straightened up, after ducking
down, did not know what to make of it at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON THE RIGHT TRACK</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Larry, thinking
he might have stumbled in on a crazy man. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t done anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not move, more, perhaps, because it was
so sudden, than from any bravery, and when the
Chinese stood in front of him, shaking his fist,
Larry maintained his ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name Pleter Manton?&rdquo; asked the Chinese,
in a high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my name&rsquo;s Larry Dexter,&rdquo; replied our
hero. &ldquo;I want to find Peter Manton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; sure yo&rsquo; no Pleter Manton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then me solly,&rdquo; the Celestial went on. &ldquo;Me
t&rsquo;ink yo&rsquo; him. Yo&rsquo; &rsquo;scuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Larry, seeing that a mistake
had been made.</p>
<p>The Chinese quieted down from the rage into
which the mention of the name Peter Manton had
seemed to throw him. He looked Larry over
closely, and then a smile came stealing upon his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; yo&rsquo; no Pleter,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;First me
take yo&rsquo; fo&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you mad at him?&rdquo; asked Larry,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He blad bloy,&rdquo; the Chinese went on. &ldquo;He
mlake tlouble for Ah Moy. He have looms up
stails, an&rsquo; him an&rsquo; odder bloys bleak windows,
an&rsquo; make all bad. Me lose money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Peter use to have a clubroom here?&rdquo;
asked Larry, feeling that at last he was getting
on the right track.</p>
<p>The Chinese nodded vigorously in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has he gone now?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>At this question the Chinese, who had seemed
to be very frank, regarded Larry suspiciously.
He half shut his eyes, which at the best were not
very widely open, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; flo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; want know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;plose he no want see yo&rsquo;?&rdquo; suggested Ah
Moy.</p>
<p>That was a puzzler for Larry. He was not
used to answering such sharp questions as the
Chinese put, and he could not understand the Celestial&rsquo;s
sudden interest in the welfare of Peter,
when, before, the Oriental had appeared to want
to punish the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to see him, even if he doesn&rsquo;t
want to see me,&rdquo; replied Larry, at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He glot some yo&rsquo; money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Arguing that the deed might be considered
money, as it represented a large sum, and feeling
sure that if Peter did not have it, he knew where
it was, Larry replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter has some of my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If me tell yo&rsquo; where Pleter is, yo&rsquo; give me
some money?&rdquo; asked Ah Moy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Larry was trying to gain time
to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He make me lose tlee dollar bleakin&rsquo; my windlow,&rdquo;
the Chinese went on. &ldquo;He an&rsquo; odder bloys
what are in club. He no pay me. Maybe yo&rsquo;
pay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you tell me where to find Peter I&rsquo;ll give
you the three dollars,&rdquo; Larry answered, thinking
it would be a sum spent in a good cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All light,&rdquo; announced Ah Moy, cheerfully.
&ldquo;Give me money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied Larry, producing the bills,
and holding them where the Chinese could see
them. &ldquo;Now you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah Moy leaned forward, first taking care to
look out toward the street, and see that no one
was headed for his store. Then he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; find door where Lising Sun painted, an&rsquo;
yo&rsquo; find Pleter, an&rsquo; maybe somebody else, li&rsquo;l
feller what cly all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean my little brother?&rdquo; exclaimed
Larry, in great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me money!&rdquo; cried Ah Moy, snatching
the bills from Larry&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Me tell yo&rsquo; where
yo&rsquo; go. Look for Lising Sun, an&rsquo; you find Pleter.
Now go. Me no like to have yo&rsquo; here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Then, before Larry could make any objections,
if he had thought to do so, the Celestial grabbed
the boy by the shoulders, and thrust him, though
not very roughly, out of the front door and into
the street. Larry heard Ah Moy close and lock
the portal behind him, and realized the Chinese
had taken an effective method of getting rid of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the queer proceedings,&rdquo; remarked
Larry. &ldquo;I seem to be getting deeper and deeper
into the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to look at the one-eyed image, but
Ah Moy had pulled down the shades, and the
place had every appearance of being deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rising sun,&rdquo; murmured Larry. &ldquo;I wonder
what he meant. Seems to me that&rsquo;s what
they call China or Japan, I&rsquo;ve forgotten which.
I hope they haven&rsquo;t taken Jimmy away off there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart grew cold at the thought, but he
reassured himself that the gang would hardly go
to that length, particularly as they might want to
produce the little fellow at short notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some place in Chinatown,&rdquo; reasoned
the young reporter. &ldquo;I must find out, but
I&rsquo;ll have to go slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what Ah Moy had told him it seemed
that the doings of Chinatown were known to
most of the members of the under-world. Consequently,
if he began making inquiries, the news
would be communicated to the members of the
gang. If they heard someone was on their trail
they might depart to another hiding-place, and
make it all the harder to locate them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask of someone who is not a Chinese,&rdquo;
thought Larry. &ldquo;Maybe the Rising Sun is the
name of some sort of a club. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll
do!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he suddenly became possessed
of an idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pretend I&rsquo;m looking for
a club of that name, and I&rsquo;ll ask the first American
storekeeper I meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry walked slowly along the street. The
thoroughfare seemed filled with Celestials, with
their wide trousers and wider-sleeved blouses,
tramping along in their thick-soled shoes, but
there seemed to be a great scarcity of Americans.
Looking about him for an establishment kept by
someone other than an almond-eyed individual,
Larry espied a block or so away, the sign of three
golden balls suspended in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pawnbroker&rsquo;s,&rdquo; thought Larry.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure to be something else besides a Chinese.
I&rsquo;ll try him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much attracted by the curious sights on every
side, Larry proceeded down the street. He looked
into the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop before entering, but
as the glass door was painted, he could discern
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; remarked Larry to himself.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what sort of information I can get.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>He opened the door softly, and stepped into
the place. In front of the counter stood a man
who seemed to be bargaining with the pawnbroker
over the amount to be loaned on an article.
They were so occupied with their business that
they did not notice the young reporter&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to give me more than twenty dollars,&rdquo;
the customer was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen is all; take it or leave it,&rdquo; was the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It is a cheap ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the diamond in the tail is worth more
than that,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;and the rubies in
the eyes are worth twice as much. Come on,
now, Isaacs, let me have twenty dollars, that&rsquo;s a
good fellow. I&rsquo;m hard up, and the gang is up
against bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something seemed to tell Larry he was on the
track of those whom he sought, but for an instant
he could not fathom what it was. There
seemed to be a clew in the mention of a diamond
in the tail and rubies in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; the young reporter thought, almost
exclaiming aloud in his excitement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
ring Mr. Reynolds told me about. The one that
was stolen from him, and which he wished to
recover because it was an heirloom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>He drew a little closer to where the man was
standing, hoping to get a look at the jewel. Nor
was he disappointed. The pawnbroker, who had
apparently made his last offer, handed something
to the customer. The latter&rsquo;s hand shook so he
dropped the article on the floor, and it rolled almost
to Larry&rsquo;s feet. The lad picked it up. He
saw that it was a ring, made in the shape of a
snake, with three coils. In the end of the tail was
a diamond, and the eyes were formed of rubies.
It was exactly like the ornament Mr. Reynolds
had described.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s heart was beating so he was afraid the
men would hear it. However, he managed to
hand the ring back to the customer, who was too
much engrossed in the transaction to notice
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Isaacs,&rdquo; the man remarked, handing the
ring over to the pawnbroker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the fifteen
dollars, but it&rsquo;s little enough. I&rsquo;ll be getting
it out again in a few days. Make out the ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry walked back to the door while the broker
was concluding the transaction. He wondered
what he had better do. Here was a chance to
get on the track of the Reynolds jewel robbers,
but to accomplish this he would have to give up,
for a time, the search after his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the two gangs should prove to be one
and the same,&rdquo; thought Larry, with a sudden inspiration.
&ldquo;I wonder if that couldn&rsquo;t be so. The
safe-robbers and the kidnappers are all together;
why not the jewel thieves? I think I&rsquo;ll chance it,
anyhow. I&rsquo;ll follow this man, and see if I can&rsquo;t
find out where he stays. I can find out about the
Rising Sun place later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>With this in mind, Larry softly slipped out of
the door, and stationed himself in a nearby hallway,
to stay until the man came from the pawn-shop.
He had not long to wait, for in a few minutes
the man emerged, and the young reporter
set off after him.</p>
<p>Larry had never had much experience in
&ldquo;shadowing&rdquo; people, as the detectives call following
a man, and not letting him know he
is under surveillance. But the lad had often
gone hunting when in the country, and had
learned how to track wild animals. Of course,
it was different in the city, but some of the principles
held true.</p>
<p>Letting the man who had pawned the ring get
about half a block ahead, Larry started after him.
The fellow did not seem to be on the lookout, but
walked on rapidly, paying no attention to persons
or objects he passed in the street.</p>
<p>Through several thoroughfares in Chinatown
the chase led, until Larry finally found himself in
the very worst section of that very bad part of
New York. The buildings were old and tumbledown,
and in spite of the sunlight overhead, it
seemed dark and gloomy.</p>
<p>The man came to a pause in front of a certain
house. He looked all about him, and Larry saw
his glance in time to dodge into a hallway. Then
the man disappeared into the building. Larry
glided forward, and was about to follow him,
when from the place several Chinese leaped out,
yelling shrilly.</p>
<p>At the same time a fusillade of revolver shots
rang out, and the yells increased. All at once
it seemed that the street was full of Chinese.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CLOSING IN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Crack! Crack! Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were the revolvers barking, and spitting
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Ki! Yi! Yee! Yip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the frightened Celestials singing out.
Those who were not yelling like cats and dogs
combined, were firing revolvers. They seemed to
have no object in view except to fire, shutting
their eyes, and pulling the trigger, while the
weapon was aimed in any and all directions.</p>
<p>One of those sudden and inexplainable shooting
affairs for which Chinatown is noted, and
which are precipitated by secret society hatreds,
was on.</p>
<p>From around the corner of the street, as if by
magic, appeared another band of Chinese. They
began firing at the throng that poured from the
building where the man who had pawned the
snake ring, had entered. Larry dodged into a
doorway, out of reach of any stray bullets.</p>
<p>Little damage seemed to be done by the shooting,
as the Celestials fired without any particular
aim. Yet one or two were hit by the bullets, and
ran about the streets howling with pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>The riot had been in progress about two minutes
before any police arrived. Then a squad of
them swung into the thoroughfare, and with
drawn clubs sprang into the midst of the mob of
Chinese. The stout sticks thumped on many a
pigtailed head, and soon the yells of rage were
turned into shouts of dismay.</p>
<p>The shooting died away, and the Orientals
scampered like rats back to their holes. Two or
three who had received bullets in their legs, were
lying in the middle of the street. Then came a
couple of patrol wagons and an ambulance, into
which the wounded were lifted, and quick trips
made to hospitals. The police took several prisoners,
who were taken to the station-house, and
then&mdash;the street became quiet again.</p>
<p>Save for a few revolvers which the owners had
thrown away, there remained no sign of the riot,
and Larry could hardly believe that he had witnessed
it. It seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must telephone the paper about it,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll keep on after that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting the address of the house into which the
pawner of the ring had vanished, Larry went
back to the Bowery, where he found a public
telephone, and was soon in communication with
Mr. Emberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay where you are until I can send one
of the reporters down to see you,&rdquo; the city editor
said. &ldquo;You can tell him what happened, and he
can write the story. Then you can go on with
your hunt. I hope you&rsquo;ll succeed. Do you need
any help?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I can get along for a while yet,&rdquo; answered
Larry. &ldquo;I only want to locate a certain
place, and then I&rsquo;ll get Mr. Newton to advise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited in the telephone station until the
reporter from the <i>Leader</i> arrived. Then, accompanied
by him, Larry went back to Chinatown.
The other reporter got a lot of information about
the riot, and, with what Larry had told him, soon
had enough for a good lively story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here goes to see what&rsquo;s in that house,&rdquo;
murmured Larry, when the reporter had left him.
&ldquo;I hope I get on the track of the Rising Sun. I
wonder what it means, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not without some little fear did he enter the
dark hallway. It was not a pleasant place. There
were odd and noisome smells, for the place, like
most of those in Chinatown, was more or less of
an opium joint. Then there was the odor of the
Joss sticks burning in a sort of improvised temple
in the rear of the first floor.</p>
<p>Up the stairs Larry went. He hardly knew
what he was going to do, nor, if he was questioned
by anyone, did he know what he would
say. He was trusting to luck. As he passed
through the dimly-lighted halls a door would
open here and there, and the head of a Chinese
would be poked out. But the portal was
quickly closed again when the owner of the head
saw it was an American youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>After a riot such as had just transpired, the
Chinese had no desire to answer embarrassing
questions such as they knew the Americans asked.
The Americans were too curious, the Celestials
thought. So it was best to stay in one&rsquo;s room, and
pretend not to hear or see anything. Thus Larry
was not interfered with or molested, as he might
have been on another occasion.</p>
<p>Though he had no definite object in view,
Larry had an idea he might chance on some evidence
as to where the man lived who had pawned
the ring, or might discover some trace of the sign
of the Rising Sun. He looked about on the walls
and doors of the halls. There were many devices
painted thereon. Dragons, snakes, strange birds,
and grinning heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go back and tell Mr. Newton,&rdquo;
thought Larry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know how to go about
this better than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there remained the third and top
floor hall to inspect, and Larry climbed the stairs
to that. He walked from the front to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here, I guess,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden beating of his heart, he
caught sight, on the door of a room at the end
of the corridor, of a crudely-painted rising sun,
with red and yellow rays radiating from it, as it
was coming up from behind a mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the place!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
reporter under his breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>The next instant he heard from behind the door
a cry as of someone in pain or distress, and to
Larry the voice sounded like that of his kidnapped
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;I wonder if Jimmy can be in
there!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>Once more the stifled cry sounded, and Larry&rsquo;s
heart almost stopped beating. He was sure he
had found his brother. He sprang forward, and
rapped loudly on the door. Instantly there
sounded a shuffling of feet from behind the portal.
Then all grew still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in!&rdquo; cried Larry.</p>
<p>He paused for a reply. Then he knocked again,
and kicked with his feet on the door, but no one
answered, and the sturdy oaken portal was not
opened. Larry was much excited. He wanted
to break down the barrier, and see what was beyond
it. He wanted to rush in, and, if his brother
was there, to tear him away from the men who
had kidnapped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go for help,&rdquo; Larry said to himself,
at length. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything alone. Anyhow,
I&rsquo;ve located the Rising Sun crowd. I&rsquo;d better
not make too much of a fuss, or they&rsquo;ll suspect
I&rsquo;m after them, and move away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried downstairs, wishing he could find
Mr. Newton at once, instead of waiting until
night, when the older reporter had promised
Larry to call at the Dexter house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s trailing the end from the sign
of the blue hand,&rdquo; thought Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>He had half a mind to see if he could not locate
the gang&rsquo;s former headquarters, but he
feared that the quest might lead him into trouble.
Also, he did not want to spoil any plans Mr. Newton
had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the only thing I can do is to wait until
to-night,&rdquo; mused Larry, &ldquo;though I hate to go
home without good news, no matter how little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he knew it was the best thing to do, and
he was soon at his house, relating to his mother
and Lucy what he had experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think he&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost certain,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;Just
you wait, mother. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have Jimmy before
another day goes by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I could believe so,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Dexter, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Mr. Newton had gone to the
former headquarters of the gang that had rooms
behind the door with the blue hand on it. As he
feared, the place was deserted, and no one in the
neighborhood knew anything about where the
former occupants had gone, or, if they did, they
would not tell. In Chinatown it is the policy of
the inhabitants to relate just as little as they can.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>With all his reporter&rsquo;s experience in tracing
matters, with all the skill which long association
with the police and detectives had given him, Mr.
Newton sought to locate some member of the
blue-handed gang to learn where their headquarters
were now. But all to no avail. Even
the advertisement Larry had inserted, agreeing
to sign the deed, was not answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Larry is having better luck than I am,&rdquo;
mused the reporter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beat, I&rsquo;m afraid. Guess
I&rsquo;ll drop in here, and get a cigar. Maybe it will
help me to think of some plan I haven&rsquo;t tried
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tobacco store nearby, and going
in, Mr. Newton purchased something to smoke.
While the proprietor was getting the change Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s attention was attracted to the sound of
voices in a rear room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one of them isn&rsquo;t Alderman Beacham and
the other Samuel Snyder, that rascally lawyer,
I&rsquo;m very much mistaken,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;re having a confab in here
for? Up to some political trick, I suppose, and
they&rsquo;re afraid to talk it over at City Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not help overhearing some of the
things that were said, and as the words came to
him he gave a sudden start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the game, eh?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No
wonder they want that deed. By the Great Horn
Spoon! but I think I&rsquo;m on the right track now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the proprietor returned with the
change, but Mr. Newton was in no hurry to go.
He pretended he wanted to buy a pipe, and, while
examining the cigar-dealer&rsquo;s stock, he kept his
ears open for anything more that might issue
from the rear room. He could only catch a stray
word now and again, but what he heard gave
him much satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>Finally he made a selection of a pipe, and paid
for it. Leaving the store he hurried off, a smile
displacing the former discouraged look his face
had worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why I never thought of that before!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the
Aldermanic Committee has been meeting in secret
so often for. That&rsquo;s the reason they would
never admit that any business was done. My!
but this is going to be a big thing! I can see a
fine story in it, and maybe a beat. I can see something
good for Larry, too, and if it doesn&rsquo;t bring
his brother back, and land some people in jail,
I&rsquo;m going to miss my guess,&rdquo; and Mr. Newton
felt so elated over the discovery he had accidentally
made that he felt like hopping and skipping
along the street. Thinking that would hardly be
in keeping with the dignity of a reporter, however,
he fell to whistling to relieve his spirits,
and warbled forth tuneful strains from a comic
opera, as being most appropriate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to see Larry, and tell him the good
news,&rdquo; thought Mr. Newton. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
make careful plans to close in on the gang. The
only thing lacking is to know where they are,
but with what I know I&rsquo;ll have no trouble finding
them. Whoop! I feel like a boy again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>He went to the Dexter home, where, though he
did not expect it, he found Larry. It was late in
the afternoon, and Mr. Newton was tired with
his quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; he asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little. How about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything we could wish for. Larry, my
boy, I think we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll nab &rsquo;em inside
of two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you get Jimmy back?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>Then he and Larry told each other their experiences,
and prepared their plans for closing in
on the gang. They could not imagine why there
was no answer to the personal they had inserted,
but, as it afterward developed, none of the gang
had seen it, not counting on it being put in so
soon after the kidnapping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NEARING THE END</span></h2>
<p>Jimmy, who had fretted all day, cried so much
the second night of his captivity that Peter and
Noddy were much alarmed. They tried their best
to comfort the lad, but he continued to weep, and
demanded to be taken to his mother and Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you amuse him in some way?&rdquo; the blue-handed
man asked of Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best,&rdquo; replied the former copy
boy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s homesick, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And small blame to him,&rdquo; put in Noddy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a bad business all around, and I&rsquo;m worried over
how we&rsquo;ll come out of it. If the kid keeps on
crying there&rsquo;ll be talk in the neighborhood, and
that may lead to an investigation. Besides he&rsquo;ll
make himself sick, and we&rsquo;ll have to send for a
doctor. That would give the game away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get a Chink doctor,&rdquo; spoke Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and have him give the kid some ground-up
snails, or pieces of birds&rsquo; nests,&rdquo; exclaimed
Noddy. &ldquo;No, sir, no Chinese quack is going to
monkey with the lad. If we have to have a doctor
we&rsquo;ll get a good one, even though it spoils
the game. I&rsquo;m not going to be responsible for
the lad&rsquo;s taking a bad turn, and maybe dying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s any danger?&rdquo; asked
Peter, who was beginning to wish he had never
had anything to do with the gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never tell what kids are going to do.
Wait, I&rsquo;ll try to tell him a story. I used to be
quite a hand at it when&mdash;when my youngster
was alive,&rdquo; and Noddy gulped down a hard lump
in his throat. Bad as he was, he still had a tender
spot in his heart for his dead child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jimmy,&rdquo; the blue-handed man said
to the captive. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you about a
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me about a giant?&rdquo; demanded
the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess so,&rdquo; and then Noddy related a
tale about a big giant who used to keep his captives
in a terrible castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sort of giant, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
Jimmy of Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What makes you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve got hands like Blue Beard,
and you keep me here, and won&rsquo;t let me go
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Noddy,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m bad enough, the land knows. I&rsquo;d let
you go home if I could. Maybe we can, to-morrow
or next day. I wish Larry would give in to
the gang, or else come here and take the kid,&rdquo;
the blue-handed man muttered, in a low tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>It required several stories before Jimmy could
be comforted, and made to forget his troubles.
He fell asleep under the influence of a fine big
Chinese drum that the blue-handed man promised
would be given him the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s in slumberland,&rdquo; remarked
Noddy, as he covered Jimmy up in bed.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand this very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening several members of the gang
came in, and Noddy laid the case before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right for you fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
you don&rsquo;t have to stay here all day and amuse the
kid, and keep him from crying for his mother.
If I only had to go out and do things the way
you do I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to stay shut up for a while
longer, on account of your hands,&rdquo; remarked
Perkins. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be very long now. I wouldn&rsquo;t
wonder but there&rsquo;d be a personal in to-morrow
morning&rsquo;s papers, saying Larry and his mother
had agreed to sign the deed. That will end the
whole matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only hope it does,&rdquo; growled Noddy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last trick of this kind you get me into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up!&rdquo; exclaimed Perkins. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
little down in the mouth now. When you get
your share out of the deal you&rsquo;ll be satisfied. I
guess the game is almost up now. There should
have been a personal in before this.&rdquo; But fate
had so ordered that the one Larry and Mr. Newton
inserted was not seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you don&rsquo;t hear from Larry?&rdquo; asked
Noddy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t inside of three days,&rdquo; answered
Perkins, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going ahead on a brand-new
plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll simply condemn the land, and then we&rsquo;ll
get it for almost nothing. Only that process is
a little slow, and we&rsquo;re in a hurry. Snyder and
Beacham had a talk on the matter somewhere to-day,
I understand, and decided the thing could
be kept secret no longer. The news will be out
in a week at the most, so whatever is done must
be done quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men talked over various other matters,
and then, as the hour was growing late, they departed,
leaving Peter and Noddy in charge of
Jimmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better turn in,&rdquo; advised the blue-handed man
to Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will,&rdquo; said the former copy boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to get up early, and get a morning paper to
see if Larry has put a personal in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was getting ready for bed Noddy
went in to look at Jimmy. He found the lad&rsquo;s
face wet with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little chap,&rdquo; remarked Noddy. &ldquo;I wish
I was out of this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he, too, went to bed, and there was silence
in the headquarters of the Rising Sun gang,
broken only by the breathing of the sleepers.
Outside the hum and confusion of Chinatown
went on in the semi-darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>Meanwhile Larry and Mr. Newton had been
planning away. They had told each other their
experiences, and Mr. Newton was glad to learn
that Larry had located the headquarters of the
gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand the man from the pawn-shop
going in there, however,&rdquo; commented the
older reporter. &ldquo;He may be mixed up with the
gang, but it hardly seems possible that the jewel
robbers, the safe-crackers, and the kidnappers are
all members of one organization. However, if
it&rsquo;s so, so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ll bag them all at once, and kill
two or three birds with one stone. Now let&rsquo;s see
what we&rsquo;d better do first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the Rising Sun gang,&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many times. They&rsquo;re about as bad as any
crowd that infests New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not get a lot of police officers, and raid
the place?&rdquo; suggested Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be all right if we could guard every
entrance,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;But they have
half a dozen, and they&rsquo;d be sure to escape through
one or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to do it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll resort to a little strategy,&rdquo; said
the older reporter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll insert another personal,
directed to the blue-handed man, asking
where we can go to sign the deed. They evidently
missed that first one. It was put in before
they expected it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>&ldquo;But do you really want me to sign the deed?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world. We&rsquo;ll simply ask them
where we can meet them to sign it. We&rsquo;re not
promising to do what they want. I&rsquo;ll write the
advertisement out now, and we can put it in all
the morning papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for an answer, and then we&rsquo;ll be
guided by what occurs next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the advertisement, carefully worded, was
prepared, and Mr. Newton took it to an agent
who made a business of inserting notices in all
the New York papers.</p>
<p>When this had been done it was evening, and,
as there seemed to be little chance of accomplishing
anything more that night, Mr. Newton advised
Larry to go to bed and get a good night&rsquo;s
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better stay around in the neighborhood
of the gang&rsquo;s headquarters,&rdquo; suggested
Larry. &ldquo;They might take Jimmy away during
the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much danger of that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;If they wanted to smuggle him away, all
the watching you could do would not stop it.
The best way is to let them think they&rsquo;re safe, and
that we know nothing about them. They probably
will do nothing for a few more days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>So the same night that Jimmy, in Noddy&rsquo;s
room, cried himself to sleep, Larry went to bed in
his own home, his head full of thoughts of the
rescue he hoped would soon be accomplished.</p>
<p>The next morning Peter went out early, and
got several papers. He and Noddy carefully
scanned the personal columns, and among the first
items that met their eyes was the advertisement
Larry and Mr. Newton had inserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; cried Noddy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to
terms at last. I&rsquo;m glad of it, for I want to see
the kid taken home. Now, Peter, you hurry off,
and tell as many members of our society as you
can find to come here at once, and we&rsquo;ll decide
on a plan of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a hasty breakfast Peter left the Rising
Sun room, and soon had delivered Noddy&rsquo;s message
to several members of the gang. They were
surprised at the news, but agreed to come to headquarters
and talk the matter over, also to decide
what would be best to do.</p>
<p>While Jimmy was kept in one of the rear
rooms, amused over the big Chinese drum which
Noddy had borrowed for him from the little Oriental
theater nearby, the members of the organization
held a consultation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, let him come here,&rdquo; suggested Perkins.
&ldquo;We can do the thing here better than anywhere
else. Let him bring his mother&rsquo;s consent in writing,
to his signing the deed, and let her send a
note agreeing that she will sign it later
on. Then let Larry come here alone. Send him a
note stating that he will be watched from the time
he leaves his house until he gets here. If he stops
to speak to anyone, or if he brings anyone with
him, the fact will be immediately telephoned to
us, and the whole thing will be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo; asked Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning that we&rsquo;ll hide the kid where he&rsquo;ll
never be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Noddy,&rdquo; spoke Randall, in
soothing tones. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no doubt but that
Larry will agree to the terms. If he doesn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll
not hurt the kid. I&rsquo;m just as fond of him as you
are. Don&rsquo;t make trouble now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll agree, as long as nothing bad happens
to the little fellow,&rdquo; stipulated the blue-handed
man.</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and a note, making all the
conditions specified, was sent to Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RAID</span></h2>
<p>The note was delivered by mail to Larry the
following day. It named Friday, two days hence,
as the time, and one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, as
the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the best time to have it happen,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Newton, when shown the missive.
&ldquo;But there are some things that are going to
make it hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say the hour is a good one?&rdquo;
asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, if we arrange matters right, we can
raid &rsquo;em in time for the last edition of the <i>Leader</i>,
and get a beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; I didn&rsquo;t think about that part of
it,&rdquo; Larry remarked. &ldquo;I was only anxious about
Jimmy. But what is going to make it hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t count on them taking so many
precautions,&rdquo; answered the older reporter. &ldquo;I
thought you and I could go together, and I figured
on being able to have several detectives stationed
near by ready to break into the place, as
soon as I gave the signal. But now it&rsquo;s got to be
done differently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they see you start for their place with anyone
they&rsquo;ll spirit Jimmy away, and probably hide
him where we&rsquo;ll never find him. So you&rsquo;ll have
to go to the place alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; observed Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not, but it upsets my plan. Then
again, I wanted to get a sort of preliminary look
at the place. From what little I can learn about
the Rising Sun gang they have a number of exits
at their headquarters. We&rsquo;ll have to guard
them all; but how can we, if we don&rsquo;t know where
to look for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Larry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be
harder than I thought. Couldn&rsquo;t we get enough
police to surround the whole block?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could, but there are two objections to that
plan. One is that if we attempt to operate on
such a large scale, some hint of our plans will
leak out. There are always some leaks in the
police department. The other objection is that
some of their exits are probably underground,
and a man, or several of them, might emerge
somewhere in the middle of the next block. No,
the only thing to do is to find where all the exits
are, and I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Ah
Moy, the Chinese who told me about the rising
sun sign on the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I had forgotten. Well, if we could
prevail on him, and he could get us the information,
it might do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;d help us, if we paid him,&rdquo;
said Larry. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know for sure whether
he knows all about the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can soon find out,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him right away, and offer him a
good sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several hours before Mr. Newton returned.
Larry was anxiously waiting for him,
and when the older reporter entered the room
in Larry&rsquo;s house where the planning was going
on, Larry burst out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Ah Moy do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely will!&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I had
to argue with him a good while, though. It seems
he is afraid of the gang, as he once belonged to
it, but got out of it for some reason or other.
But, luckily enough, he knows the layout of the
rooms as well as he knows how to read a Chinese
laundry ticket, which is no joke. He drew a
rough sort of a plan for me, and with that I think
I can get ahead of the gang. Now, Larry, I&rsquo;ll
tell you what I think we&rsquo;d better do. When I
get through, if you have anything better to propose,
don&rsquo;t hesitate to say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, now that I know where all
the exits are, and they are seven in number, I
can arrange to have a detective placed at each
one. Luckily, they are some distance apart, so
stationing men in plain clothes at them will not
attract attention. As I surmised, there is one
exit on a separate block from the one where the
building is.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the appointed time you&rsquo;ll start for the
gang&rsquo;s headquarters. You&rsquo;ll go all alone, but
I&rsquo;ll be close behind you,&rdquo; went on Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. For the first time in my life I&rsquo;m
going to disguise myself a bit. I&rsquo;ll wear a false
beard. Well, you&rsquo;ll enter the room, just as their
note tells you. What will happen inside, of course,
I can&rsquo;t say. You&rsquo;ll have to be governed by circumstances.
But don&rsquo;t be afraid, and don&rsquo;t forget
that help will be near. When you call out I&rsquo;ll
break in the door, and give the signal for the detectives
to close in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll not be able to hear me shout,&rdquo;
Larry suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a ways to the
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the hallway,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;But, at the same time, perhaps a revolver shot
would be a better signal. You can take a pistol
with blank cartridges in it. That will do as well
as one with bullets, and then no one will be shot
by accident, for, though the gang is bad enough,
we don&rsquo;t want any serious results, if we can help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come to my aid when I fire one
shot?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are you going to get into the hallway
without being seen? They are going to keep
strict watch, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me. Now is there anything you
don&rsquo;t understand, or anything you would
change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I understand it all,&rdquo; spoke Larry,
&ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t alter a single bit of it. I wish
it was time to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton, with a laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got too much to do to have the raid happen
until the appointed time. But when that comes,
I&rsquo;ll be ready for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of that day and part of the next Mr.
Newton found all too short for what he had to
do. He made many trips, and saw a number of
persons, taking care to see that he was not followed,
especially when he went to police headquarters.
One visit he made late at night, and
that was to a costumer&rsquo;s, where he bought a wig
and false beard.</p>
<p>On the morning of Friday, the day planned for
the raid, Mr. Newton spent some time at City
Hall. He was closeted with the mayor and several
of the city officials, and the result of his interviews
seemed to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>At last the hour arrived when Larry was to
set out from his house for the headquarters of
the gang. His mother bade him a tearful good-by,
and Lucy, as she kissed him, told him she
was sure it would all come out right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>If Larry was watched or followed, he was not
able to detect it, though he had no doubt the gang
had some one of its members &ldquo;shadowing&rdquo; him.
He reached Chinatown. The streets, as usual,
were filled with shuffling Orientals, who seemed
to have no particular object in view. Larry
looked to see if he could catch a sight of Mr.
Newton, or any of the detectives, but none was in
sight.</p>
<p>He reached the building, and, with a heart that
beat wildly in spite of his efforts to remain calm,
he started up the stairs. He felt to see if the revolver
was safe in the outside pocket of his coat.
Mr. Newton had told him to place it there, and
to fire it while the weapon was inside the pocket,
since to draw it might cause some hasty action on
the part of some member of the gang.</p>
<p>Larry gave a timid tap at the door with the
rising sun painted on it. The portal instantly
swung back, though no one appeared, and a voice
called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young reporter entered. He found himself
in a sort of corridor, at the end of which was
a room, brightly-lighted, in spite of the fact that
it was broad daylight outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on into the room,&rdquo; the voice directed, and
Larry walked forward.</p>
<p>He found a number of men seated about a table.
One wore gloves, and as they were not fastened,
Larry had a glimpse of the hands they covered.
The skin on them was blue, and Larry
knew that at last he had run the blue-handed man
to his lair. The others, and there were five of
them, glanced sharply at the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see you&rsquo;ve agreed to our terms,&rdquo; said
Perkins, who acted as spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Larry, his voice trembling a little.
&ldquo;Where is my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You stick to
your part of the agreement, and we will to ours.
Where is your mother&rsquo;s note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry began fumbling in his pocket. At the
same time, with wildly-beating heart, he was
wondering whether he should give the signal for
help. He did not quite know how to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, the note!&rdquo; said Perkins, impatiently.</p>
<p>Just at that instant a roughly-dressed man,
with a plumber&rsquo;s kit of tools on his shoulder, was
entering the hallway downstairs. As he crossed
the threshold, another man, with a long scar on
his face, lurched forward, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one allowed in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the plumber, sent to fix a leaky pipe,&rdquo;
announced the one with the tools, as he brushed
past the man who sought to bar his progress.</p>
<p>Moving quickly but silently, the man with the
plumber&rsquo;s tools came to a halt in front of the door
with the rising sun on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place. Now to wait until I hear
a shot,&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;I hope the detectives
are all in their places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry continued to fumble for the note. He
wanted to gain time, and likewise he wanted to
see the deed produced, since he knew it must be
hidden somewhere in the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sign it now, and my mother can later,&rdquo;
spoke Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not the agreement!&rdquo; said Perkins,
sharply. &ldquo;Are you trying to trick us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant there came a cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry! Larry! I want Larry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jimmy!&rdquo; burst out Larry. &ldquo;Where are
you, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him out of here! He&rsquo;s trying to trick
us!&rdquo; shouted Perkins. Larry made a dash for
the room whence his brother&rsquo;s voice had sounded.
Perkins jumped up to bar his progress. At the
same time all the others in the room rose from
their chairs.</p>
<p>Larry thrust his hand into the pocket containing
the revolver. Without drawing the weapon
he fired.</p>
<p>At the sound of the report Perkins yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped! Every man for himself!
Scatter! I&rsquo;ll take the kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, as the sound of the report came
to him, the man with the plumber&rsquo;s kit of tools,
who had been standing outside the door, drew
from the bundle a short but heavy hammer, and
with one blow smashed the lock.</p>
<p>As the portal flew open he leaped inside, at
the same time blowing shrilly on a whistle he
placed to his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the time Harvey Newton does a bit of
real detective work!&rdquo; he cried, smiling grimly as
he dashed toward the lighted room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WHAT THE OLD DEED BROUGHT</span></h2>
<p>The place was a scene of confusion. The men
were trying to escape, each seeking one of the
several secret exits. Perkins dashed toward the
room whence the cry of the child had proceeded.</p>
<p>Larry, whose first thought was to rescue
Jimmy, watched this man. He saw him emerge
from the apartment, with the captive under his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop him!&rdquo; cried the young reporter, leaping
on the back of Perkins.</p>
<p>Anger lent Larry strength. He clasped his
arms about the kidnapper, and loosened the man&rsquo;s
grip on Jimmy. The little chap was yelling with
fear, but as soon as he caught sight of his brother
his tears ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me home, Larry!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Perkins rolled over and over, the force of his
fall caused by Larry&rsquo;s sudden impact sending him
spinning. Then, thinking only of his own safety,
the man rose to his feet and sped down a secret
passageway, while Larry gathered Jimmy close in
his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Newton, who had torn off the
false beard and wig, was grappling with Randall.
They were having a fierce struggle, when
two detectives who had been stationed outside,
and who had dashed in at the sound of Mr. Newton&rsquo;s
whistle, sprang on Randall, and soon made
him a prisoner.</p>
<p>At this the blue-handed man, seeing that the
game was up, made a spring for the mantel. He
sought to grasp what looked like an old newspaper,
but Mr. Newton, seeing his movement,
sent him sprawling with a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here with the handcuffs, Jack,&rdquo; the reporter
cried to one of the detectives, and soon Noddy
was secured.</p>
<p>The others of the gang had scattered, and one
of the detectives was about to follow them down
a passage that led from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be
caught before they go very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve got us right,&rdquo; said Noddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you only had one guess, you&rsquo;d win,&rdquo; remarked
the reporter, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you came, Larry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jimmy. &ldquo;I was so lonesome! I thought you
would never get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get right home with him, Larry,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;Your mother will be worried,
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the deed?&rdquo; asked the young reporter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I suppose
we&rsquo;ll have a job hunting for it. They&rsquo;ve
probably got it hidden away somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Noddy&rsquo;s face took on a queer
look, and he almost smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll find it later,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;The chief thing now is to relieve your mother&rsquo;s
anxiety. Take Jimmy home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my kite,&rdquo; said the lad. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go
without my kite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it to you later,&rdquo; said Larry, trying
to quiet the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want it now,&rdquo; insisted Jimmy. &ldquo;There
&rsquo;tis, up on the shelf,&rdquo; and he pointed to where
one of the Chinese bird kites was on the mantel.
To please him Larry reached for it. The toy
seemed to be caught, and, in pulling it down,
Larry brought a folded newspaper with it. The
paper fell to the floor. Noddy was eying it narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the paper away, and bring the kite
along,&rdquo; said Larry to Jimmy, who had picked up
both articles. The little fellow obeyed. Something
in the way in which the newspaper fell to
the ground attracted Mr. Newton&rsquo;s attention.
He picked it up. As he unfolded it he uttered
an exclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the missing deed!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well,
well, this is a lucky find! We might have hunted
for a week, and never thought of looking in the
folds of an old newspaper. Good for you and
your kite, Jimmy! Here, Larry, take this along
home with your brother. Unless I miss my guess,
it&rsquo;s going to be worth considerable to you in the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Larry started away with his brother, the
deed safely buttoned in an inner pocket, some of
the detectives began crowding into the room with
their prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you land &rsquo;em all right?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one, I guess,&rdquo; replied Sergeant Barnett,
who was in charge of the squad. &ldquo;They
came out of the different exits like rats from their
holes, and my men nabbed them. We even got
that kid, Peter. My, but he was a scared one!
It was all Scanlon could do to hold him, he fought
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you can take &rsquo;em away now,&rdquo;
said Mr. Newton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get busy and
&rsquo;phone the story in. Don&rsquo;t say anything to any
reporters from the other papers, until I have a
chance to get my yarn in, Barnett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; promised the sergeant.</p>
<p>The patrol-wagon was sent for, and soon the
prisoners were on their way to the station-house.
In the meanwhile Mr. Newton telephoned in the
story of the raid on the Rising Sun gang; every
member who had been in the headquarters having
been captured. The story was a beat for the
<i>Leader</i>&mdash;one of the biggest of the year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>As for Larry, he lost no time hurrying home
with Jimmy and the deed. When he entered the
house, Mrs. Dexter was so excited she almost
fainted, and the neighbors, hearing the good
news about the return of the kidnapped boy,
crowded in to learn the particulars.</p>
<p>Larry told them as well as he could, and then,
when the rooms became quiet, and the neighbors
had gone to their apartments, he and his mother
sat down, and Mrs. Dexter indulged in a good
cry. Larry felt a little like it himself, now that
the excitement was over, but he decided it was
hardly what ought to be done under the circumstances.</p>
<p>As for Jimmy he hardly knew whether to stand
on his head or his feet. He danced around,
hugged Mary, Lucy, his mother, and Larry, and
then told of his experiences, as well as he could,
in the Chinese den.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the prisoners were safely lodged
in cells, all but Peter. In consideration of his
youth, he was sent to the rooms of a society that
took charge of wayward boys.</p>
<p>As soon as he had telephoned the story in to
his paper, Mr. Newton went to Larry&rsquo;s house.
He had discarded his disguise, leaving the plumber&rsquo;s
outfit behind, and once more looked like himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over, Larry,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;and I guess we came out with flying colors. I
couldn&rsquo;t have done it any better myself, inside
that room with the gang. Your signal came just
at the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s over, and that Jimmy is
safe,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t all over yet, by a good bit,&rdquo; said
Mr. Newton. &ldquo;But I trust your worries are.
Where&rsquo;s that deed, Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that old deed,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Dexter.
&ldquo;I never want to see it again. It was the cause
of all our trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it may be the cause of a good deal
of happiness,&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that paper is the title to a valuable
piece of real estate. Of course you knew as much
as that before, but you didn&rsquo;t know just what.
It develops that the Board of Aldermen have decided
to make a big park up in the Bronx section.
They have been keeping quiet about it so as
not to have property values in that vicinity rise
before they had a chance to buy what they
wanted. But now that they have all they need,
excepting the piece you have the deed to, they have
announced their plans. You can read about them
in the last edition of the <i>Leader</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our property is part of what will be the
park?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, and a valuable part, too. I was
told by the aldermanic committee that they were
prepared to offer you twenty thousand dollars
for the land. If they do, and I think they will,
I advise you to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will!&rdquo; shouted Larry. &ldquo;Think
of twenty thousand dollars! We&rsquo;ll be rich,
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly rich,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Newton,
&ldquo;but it will help some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder the gang wanted to get possession
of the land,&rdquo; observed Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was their game,&rdquo; went on Mr. Newton.
&ldquo;They learned you had the deed to one of the
most valuable pieces. For a long time I could
not understand why they wanted it. I suspected
some big improvement was going to be made in
that section, but I could not learn what. As soon
as I overheard the conversation in the cigar-store
that day I got on the track. The rest was
easy. We only had to follow the different clews,
and as it happened they all led to one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the gang is mixed up in the
safe-robbery and the Reynolds jewels job, as well
as the land transaction?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are. You see, we practically
have proof of the safe-robbery, now that we have
the blue-handed man. As for the Reynolds job,
the snake ring is enough to fasten that on at least
one member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tried to do too much, that was the trouble.
Some of the criminals heard of this land
scheme from the Aldermen&mdash;Beacham especially&mdash;and
they decided to get that money. If
they succeeded in getting control of the land
they would have forced the city to pay a very
high price for it. When they found fair means
would not accomplish their object they tried foul.
But it&rsquo;s all over now, and we won out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p>The arrest of the gang, the story in the <i>Leader</i>,
and the disclosures made concerning the land
and other operations, made a big sensation.
Larry and Mr. Newton, who had succeeded not
only in running the gang to earth, but in getting
a story that was a beat, were congratulated on all
sides.</p>
<p>The stories ran through the papers for several
days. The proof of the robbery of the jewelry
store safe was easy, once the blue-handed man
was in custody. Eventually those concerned in
it were sentenced to prison for long terms. Then
it was proved that at least one of the gang, the
man who had pawned the snake ring, was concerned
in the Reynolds robbery, from which, as
told in the first volume, Larry was instrumental
in saving the jewels, and this time he got back
the heirloom.</p>
<p>Regarding the deed, as Mr. Newton had said,
it proved to be of great value. The city made an
offer of twenty thousand dollars for the land,
and Mrs. Dexter sold it. After all expenses and
some back taxes had been paid, she found she had
over seventeen thousand dollars, part of which
belonged to Larry and the other children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>Peter was sent to a reform school in the hope
that he would mend his ways, while the men who
had been instrumental in kidnapping Jimmy, and
in stealing the deed the night the fire was started
in the tenement, received long sentences in the
state prison.</p>
<p>A few days after he had received notification
that he and his mother would receive the big
sum for the Bronx land, Larry was back at the
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Larry,&rdquo; said Mr. Emberg, with a smile,
&ldquo;I suppose now that you&rsquo;re fairly well off, you&rsquo;ll
not remain a reporter any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you&rsquo;ll keep me,&rdquo; replied the youth.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go away from the <i>Leader</i>, Mr.
Emberg. I&rsquo;ve only just begun to be a good reporter.
I haven&rsquo;t learned half the business yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want to stay, I&rsquo;m sure we want
you,&rdquo; said the city editor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d hate to have
you go, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to stay. I&rsquo;m going to continue
my studies, and maybe some day I&rsquo;ll get a
real big assignment,&rdquo; spoke Larry.</p>
<p>And, with this ambition urging him on, we
will take leave of Larry for a while. When next
we hear of him, provided you care to read any
more of his adventures, you may learn what he
did in a story called, &ldquo;Larry Dexter&rsquo;s Special
Assignment; or, The Hunt for the Missing Millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you like reporting, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Newton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; answered Larry. &ldquo;In fact,
there is nothing that I like better. The life is
full of excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And occasional perils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the dangers can&rsquo;t be helped, Mr. Newton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. Well, Larry, I think, if you
stick at it, you will make one of the best reporters
in New York&mdash;and that is saying a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
